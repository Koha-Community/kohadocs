Contributing to the Documentation
=================================
This manual is an ever-changing document and edits to the manual are welcome at any time.

The Koha Manual is managed by the Documentation Team, but that doesn't mean we can't all participate in making the best manual possible.

The manual is stored in git at: http://git.koha-community.org/gitweb/?p=kohadocs.git;a=summary
and at https://gitlab.com/koha-community-devs-users/kohadocs

The manual is written using Sphinx, so you can use any text editor to edit it, please
see the README.md file for more details

Patches to the manual can be submitted as merge requests on gitlab and will be reviewed by the Documentation Team before inclusion.

Any questions you have or documenation you want to share can be send to the koha-docs mailing list: <https://lists.koha-community.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/koha-docs>
