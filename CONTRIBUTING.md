Contributing to the Documentation
=================================
This manual is an ever-changing document and edits to the manual are welcome at any time.

The Koha Manual is managed by the Documentation Manager, but that doesn't mean we can't all participate in making the best manual possible.

The manual is stored in git at: http://git.koha-community.org/gitweb/?p=kohadocs.git;a=summary
and at https://gitlab.com/koha-community-devs-users/kohadocs

The manual is written using Sphinx, so you can use any text editor to edit it, please
see the README.md file for more details

Patches to the manual should be emailed to the DOCS mailing
list <https://lists.koha-community.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/koha-docs>
and will be reviewed by the Documentation Manager before inclusion.

Or you can submit merge requests at https://gitlab.com/koha-community-devs-users/kohadocs
