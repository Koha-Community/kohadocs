Koha recommendations
------------------------------------------

Full system recommendations can be found on the official Koha wiki along
with the developer documentation: http://wiki.koha-community.org

When working in the Koha staff client it is strongly recommended that
you use an up-to-date version of either Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
Koha's staff client may not work well in Microsoft Internet Explorer,
especially older versions.

This manual is always changing and suggestions for edits can be sent to
the Koha documentation team as a merge request via gitlab or via the 
`koha-docs mailing list 
<https://lists.koha-community.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/koha-docs>`__.

If you see an error or something missing, please file a bug report on

The manual is organized by Koha module. At the start of most sections
(and throughout) you will find 'Get there' tips. These lines tell you
how to get to the section in Koha.

For example: 
*Get there:* More > Administration > Global system preferences

The instruction tells you where to find the necessary menu option at the
top of the Koha staff client.

manual and images will depict what should be seen on the screen.
