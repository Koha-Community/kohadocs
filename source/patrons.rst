Patrons
=======

Before importing and/or adding patrons be sure to set up your :ref:`patron
categories <patron-categories-label>`.

.. _add-a-new-patron-label:

Add a new patron
------------------------------------

Patrons are added by going to the 'Patrons' module.

-  *Get there:* Patrons

Once there you can add a new patron.

-  Click 'New patron'

   |image407|

-  The fields that appear on the patron add form can be controlled by
   editing the :ref:`BorrowerUnwantedField` system
   preference.

-  First enter the identifying information regarding your patron

   |image408|

   -  Required fields are defined in the
      :ref:`BorrowerMandatoryField` system
      preference

   -  Salutation is populated by the
      :ref:`BorrowersTitles` system preference

   -  **Note**

          If you'd like to prevent full names from printing on
          :ref:`slips <notices-&-slips-label>` and you're not using the Initials or
          Other name fields for anything else, you can use them for
          shortened versions of the name to then be printed on the slip.

          For example:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole C.
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: NCE

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>> instead of the full name (NCE).

          Or you could do something like this:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: E

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>>, <<borrowers.firstname>> instead of the
          full name (E, Nicole).

-  Next enter the contact information

   |image409|

   -  For contact information, note that the primary phone and email
      addresses are the ones that appear on notices and slips printed
      during circulation (receipts, transfer slips and hold slips). The
      primary email is also the one that overdue notices and other
      messages go to.

-  If this patron is a child, you will be asked to attach the child
   patron to an adult patron

   |image410|

   -  Click 'Set to patron' to search your system for an existing patron

   -  If the Guarantor is not in the system, you can enter the first and
      last name in the fields available

   -  The relationships are set using the
      :ref:`borrowerRelationship` system preference

-  If this patron is a professional, you will be asked to attach the
   patron to an organizational patron

   |image411|

   -  Click 'Set to patron' to search your system for an existing patron

-  Each patron can have an alternate contact

   |image412|

   -  An alternate contact could be a parent or guardian. It can also be
      used in academic settings to store the patron's home address.

-  The library management section includes values that are used within
   the library

   |image413|

   -  The card number field is automatically calculated if you have the
      :ref:`autoMemberNum` system preference set that way

      -  **Note**

             For a newly installed system this preference will start at
             1 and increment by 1 each time after. To have it start with
             the starting number of your barcodes, enter the first
             barcode by hand in the patron record and save the patron.
             After that the field will increment that number by 1.

   -  If you accidentally chose the wrong patron category at the
      beginning you can fix that here

   -  Sort 1 and 2 are used for statistical purposes within your library
      
   -  'Check for previous checkouts' is used to set the patron's personal preference 
      regarding checking their circulation history to see if they have borrowed this 
      item in the past. This overrides the setting of the :ref:`patron category 
      <adding-a-patron-category>` and of the :ref:`CheckPrevCheckout` system preference.

-  Next, the library set-up section includes additional library settings

   |image414|

   -  The registration date will automatically be filled in with today's
      date

   -  If your patron cards expire (based on your :ref:`patron category
      settings <patron-categories-label>`) the expiry date will automatically be
      calculated

   -  The OPAC note is a note for the patron - it will appear in the
      OPAC on the patron's record

   -  The Circulation note is meant solely for your library staff and
      will appear when the circulation staff goes to check an item out
      to the patron

      |image415|

   -  The Staff/OPAC asks for the username and password to be used by
      the patron (and/or staff member) to log into their account in the
      OPAC and for staff to log in to the staff client.

      -  Staff will only be able to use this log in info to log in to
         the staff client if they have the :ref:`necessary
         permissions <patron-permissions-label>`.

-  If you have set :ref:`additional patron
   attributes <patron-attribute-types-label>` up, these will appear next

   |image416|

-  Finally, if you have
   :ref:`EnhancedMessagingPreferences` set
   to 'allow,' you can choose the messaging preferences for this patron.

   |image417|

   -  These notices are:

      -  Advanced notice: A notice in advance of the patron's items
         being due (the patron can choose the number of days in advance)

      -  Item checkout: A notice that lists all the of the items the
         patron has just checked out and/or renewed, this is an
         electronic form of the checkout receipt

      -  Hold filled: A notice when you have confirmed the hold is
         waiting for the patron

      -  Item due: A notice on the day and item is due back at the
         library

      -  Item check-in: A notice that lists all the of the items the
         patron has just checked in

   -  Patrons can choose to receive their notices as a digest by
      checking the 'Digest only?' box along with the delivery method. A
      digest is a combination of all the messages of that type (so all
      items due in 3 days in one email) in to one email instead of
      multiple emails for each alert.

   -  **Important**

          These preferences will override any you set via the :ref:`patron
          categories <adding-a-patron-category-label>`

   -  **Important**

          These preference can be altered by the patron via the OPAC

-  Once finished, click 'Save'

If the system suspects this patron is a duplicate of another it will
warn you.

|image418|

    **Note**

    A duplicate patron is detected if first and last names match and
    there is no date of birth populated or if first name, last name and
    date of birth fields are all populated. If two patrons have matching
    names, but one has a date of birth and the other does not they will
    not match as duplicates.

If you have set a minimum or upper age limit on the patron category and
are requiring that the birth date be filled in, Koha will warn you if
the patron you're adding is too old or young for the patron category you
have selected:

|image419|

.. _quick-add-patron-label:

Quick add a patron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your circulation desk is very busy and you want to register patron quickly, 
you can use the 'quick add' feature. It's a shortened version of the add 
patron form with only a couple of necessary fields to fill out.

This feature uses two system preferences: :ref:`BorrowerMandatoryField` 
and :ref:`PatronQuickAddFields`. These are the two system preferences that
control which fields are in the quick add form.

To quick add a patron, go to the Patrons module

-  *Get there:* Patrons

Click on the 'Quick add new patron' button.

You will be asked to choose a patron category.

Then, you will be presented with a shortened form.

|image1346|

Once the form is filled out, click on 'Save'.

If you need to access the full form, you can click on 'Show full form' 
above the 'Save' button.


.. _add-a-staff-patron-label:

Add a staff patron
----------------------------------------

All staff members must be entered into Koha as patrons of the 'Staff'
type. Follow the steps in :ref:`Add a Patron <add-a-new-patron-label>` to add a
staff member. To give the staff member permissions to access the staff
client, follow the steps in :ref:`patron permissions <patron-permissions-label>`

    **Important**

    Remember to assign your staff secure usernames and passwords since
    these will be used to log into the staff client.

.. _add-a-statistical-patron-label:

Add a statistical patron
----------------------------------------------

One way to track use of in house items is to "check out" the materials
to a statistical patron. The "check out" process doesnâ€™t check the book
out, but instead tracks an in house use of the item. To use this method
for tracking in house use you first will need a :ref:`patron
category <patron-categories-label>` set up for your statistical patron.

|image420|

Next, you will need to create a new patron of the statistical type.

|image421|

Next, follow the steps put forth in the ':ref:`Add a new
patron <add-a-new-patron-label>`' section of this manual. Since this patron is
not a real person, simply fill in the required fields, the correct
library and nothing else.

To learn about other methods of tracking in house use visit the
:ref:`tracking inhouse use <tracking-in-house-use-label>` section of this manual.

.. _duplicate-a-patron-label:

Duplicate a patron
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes when you're adding a new family to your system you don't want
to type the contact information over and over. Koha allows for you to
duplicate a patron and change only the parts you want to (or need to)
change.

-  Open the patron you want to use as your base (the patron you want to
   duplicate information from)

-  Click the 'Duplicate' button at the top of their record

   |image422|

-  All of the fields with the exception of first name, card number,
   username and password have been duplicated. Fill in the missing
   pieces and click 'Save'

   |image423|

   -  **Note**

          Clicking in a field that is already populated with data will
          clear that field of all information (making it easier for you
          to type in something different)

-  You will be brought to your new patron

   |image424|

.. _add-patron-images-label:

Add patron images
----------------------------------------

If you would like you can add patron images to help identify patrons. To
enable this feature you must first set the
:ref:`patronimages` preference to 'Allow'.

If the preference is set to 'Allow' you will see a placeholder image
under the patron's name and box to upload a patron image below the basic
contact information.

|image425|

In the 'Upload patron image' box click 'Browse' to find the image on
your computer and 'Upload' to load the image on to the patron record.

|image426|

    **Important**

    There is a limit of 100K on the size of the picture uploaded and it
    is recommended that the image be 200x300 pixels, but smaller images
    will work as well.

.. _editing-patrons-label:

Editing patrons
----------------------------------

Patrons in Koha can be edited using one of many edit buttons.

-  To edit the entire patron record simply click the 'Edit' button at
   the top of the patron record.

   |image427|

-  Patron passwords are not recoverable. The stars show on the patron
   detail next to the Password label are always there even if a password
   isn't set. If a patron forgets their password the only option is to
   reset their password. To change the patron's password, click the
   'Change password' button.

   |image428|

   -  Koha cannot display existing passwords. Leave the field blank to
      leave password unchanged.

   -  This form can automatically generate a random password if you
      click the link labeled "Click to fill with a randomly generated
      suggestion. Passwords will be displayed as text."

-  To edit a specific section of the patron record (for example the
   'Library use' section) click the 'Edit' link below the section.

   |image429|

-  A patron image can be added by browsing for the image on your machine
   from the 'Manage patron image' section.

   |image430|

   -  This form will not appear if you have the
      :ref:`patronimages` system preference to not allow
      patron images.

   -  To add patron images in bulk, use the :ref:`Upload patron
      images <upload-patron-images-label>` tool.

-  Patrons can also be blocked from checking items out by setting Patron
   flags

   |image431|

   -  If you would like your circulation staff to confirm a patron's
      address before checking items out to the patron, you can see the
      'Gone no address' flag

      |image432|

   -  If the patron reports that they have lost their card you can set
      the 'Lost card' flag to prevent someone else from using that card
      to check items out

      |image433|

   -  If you would like to bar a patron from the library you can add a
      manual restriction

      |image434|

      -  **Note**

             This flag can automatically be set with the :ref:`Overdue/notice
             status triggers <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`

   -  If you enter in a date and/or note related to the restriction you
      will see that in the restricted message as well

      |image435|

-  Children patrons do not become adults automatically in Koha unless
   you have :ref:`Juvenile to adult cron job <update-child-to-adult-patron-type-label>` running. To
   upgrade a child patron to and adult patron category manually go to
   the 'More' menu and choose 'Update child to adult patron'

   |image436|

   -  You will then be presented with a pop up window asking which one
      of your adult patron categories this Child should be updated to

      |image437|

.. _managing-patron-self-edits-label:

Managing patron self edits
--------------------------------------------------

If you are allowing patrons to edit their accounts via the OPAC with the
:ref:`OPACPatronDetails` preference then you will need
to approve all changes via the staff client before they're applied. If
there are patron edits awaiting action they will appear on the staff
client dashboard below the modules list (along with other items awaiting
action).

|image438|

    **Note**

    Superlibrarians will see modifications for any branch, other staff
    will only see modifications for patrons who belong to their logged
    in branch.

When you click the 'Patrons requesting modifications' link you will be
brought to a list of patrons with requested changes.

|image439|

From here you can 'Approve' and apply the changes to the patron record,
'Delete' and remove the changes or 'Ignore' and keep the changes pending
to review later.

If you would like to see the entire patron record you can click the
'Patron details' links to the right of the buttons. This will open in a
new tab.

Merging patron records
-----------------------------------

If you accidentally end up with one patron with two cards it is possible
to merge their records together so that you don't lose their loan history
or holds.

-  In the patron list, check the boxes next to the records you want to
   merge and click on the 'Merge selected patrons' button.

|image1326|

    **Note**

    It is possible to merge more than two records at a time.

-  Select the patron record you want to keep and click on the 'Merge
   patrons' button.

|image1327|

The checkouts and statistics will be transferred to the right record and
the other one will be deleted.

|image1328|

.. _patron-permissions-label:

Patron permissions
-------------------------------------------

Patron permissions are used to allow staff members access to the staff
client.

    **Important**

.. _circulation-summary-label:

Circulation summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below the patron's information on the details screen is a tabbed display
of the items they have checked out, overdue, and on hold.

Checkouts
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The first tab shows the items the patron currently has checked out.

|image445|

Relatives' checkouts
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If they have family at the library, staff can see what the other family
members have checked out.

|image446|

Fines & charges
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Fines & charges tab will show for all patrons, even those who
don't owe anything.

If the patron does owe money to the library, the tab will show the
total amount, without any details. To see the details, go to the
:ref:`fines tabs <fines-label>`.

|image1360|

Holds
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If the patron has holds, the number of holds will appear on this tab's
title and the details will appear in the tab.

|image490|

     **Note**

     The barcode and call number will only appear on item-level holds or
     holds that have been confirmed. Record-level holds that are not
     waiting to be picked up will not have barocdes or call numbers.

From here you can manage the patron's holds: change the pickup library,
cancel or suspend holds.

     **Note**

     You will only be able to suspend holds if the :ref:`SuspendHoldsIntranet`
     system preference is set to "Allow".

     **Note**

     If, when suspending a hold, you want to be able to set a date at which to
     automatically resume the hold, set the :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds`
     system preference to "Allow" and make sure the :ref:`unsuspend_holds cron
     job <unsuspend-holds-label>` is activated.

Article requests
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If the :ref:`ArticleRequests` system preference is enabled, and the circulation
rules allow it, the patrons will be able to request articles, either through the
OPAC or in the staff interface.

The details of the patron's request, and its status, are visible in this
tab.

|image1361|

Restrictions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Restrictions tab will show for all patrons. If the patron has no
restrictions you will see that on the tab.

|image447|

If the patron has restrictions on their account the tab will show the
number and the description.

There are four kinds of restrictions:
  - Manual
  - Overdues
  - Suspension
  - Discharge

Using the 'Add manual restriction' button you can add a restriction to
the patron record from here. This can be used for any type of restriction
you need to put manually on a patron record.

|image449|

|image448|

The overdues restrictions are automatically set when overdue notices are sent
if you specified you wanted the patron restricted in the
:ref:`Overdue notice/status triggers tool <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`.

This restriction will not be removed automatically when the overdue items are
returned unless the :ref:`AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions` system preference
is set to 'Do'.

In the :ref:`circulation rules <circulation-and-fine-rules-label>`, you can choose
to fine users by suspending them instead of (or in addition to) fining them money.
In that case, returning an overdue document will trigger a suspension restriction.

Patrons may also be restricted if you have issued a :ref:`discharge <patron-
discharges-label>` for them. Once the discharge is validated, the patron is
automatically restricted.

Restrictions on a patron record will block checkouts. In fact,
a message will appear in red when going to the checkout page.

|image1363|

Restrictions may also prevent renewing items if the :ref:`RestrictionBlockRenewing`
system preference is set to 'block'.

On the OPAC, patrons will get a message saying their account is frozen. They will
not be able to place holds from the OPAC.

If you have patrons that have more than one restriction, you can choose to
cumulate their restriction periods or not through the :ref:`CumulativeRestrictionPeriods`
system preference.

     **Note**

     If you want to restrict patrons from doing various actions if their record
     is not pristine, check the following system preferences:

     - Set the :ref:`OverduesBlockCirc` system preference to 'Block' to prevent
       patrons who have overdue materials from checking out other materials.
     - Set the :ref:`OverduesBlockRenewing` system preference to 'block renewing
       for all the patron's items' or 'block renewing only for this item' to prevent
       patrons who have overdue materials from renewing their loans.
     - Enter values in the :ref:`noissuescharge` and :ref:`NoIssuesChargeGuarantees`
       system preferences in order to block checking out to patrons who have more
       than a certain amount in fines or to patrons whose guarantees owe more than
       a certain amount.
     - Enter a value in the :ref:`maxoutstanding` system preference to prevent
       patron from placing holds on the OPAC if they owe more than a certain amount.
     - Enter a value in the :ref:`OPACFineNoRenewals` system preference to prevent
       patron who owe more than a certain amount to renew their loans from the OPAC.
     - Set the :ref:`BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions` system preference to 'Block' if
       you want to prevent patron whose membership has expired to place hold or
       renew their loans from the OPAC.

in their record indicating which club they are enrolled in, if any.

      instead of 'Starts with'

      it was entered or by searching for 212 555 1212

-  Street address:

   -  Enter any part of the patron's address (includes all address
      fields) and choose 'Contains' instead of 'Starts with' to find the
      string anywhere in the address

-  Date of birth

   -  Birth dates should be entered using the format set forth in the
      :ref:`dateformat` preference.

-  Sort field 1

   -  This is a custom field that libraries can use for any type of data
      about the patron.

-  Sort field 2

   -  This is a custom field that libraries can use for any type of data
      about the patron.

You can also choose to either search for fields that start with the
string you entered or contain the string. Choosing 'Contains' will work
like a wildcard search.

letters across the top.
