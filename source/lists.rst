A list can be created by visiting the Lists page and clicking 'New list'

The new list form offers several options for creating your list:

-  The name is what will appear on the list of lists

-  You can also choose how to sort the list

-  Next, decide if your list is going to be private or public

   -  A private list can be seen only by you

   -  A public list can be seen by everybody

-  Finally decide what your permissions will be on the list. You can allow
   changes to the list from:

   -  Nobody: this will close the list to contributions

   -  Owner only: only you will be able to add or remove items from the list

   -  Anyone seeing this list: other users will be able to add or remove
      items from the list

A list can also be created from the catalog search results

Merging bibliographic records via lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One way to merge together duplicate bibliographic records is to add them
to a list and use the merge tool from there.

|image877|

Once you have selected the records to merge together the process is the
same as if you had chosen to :ref:`merge via cataloging <merging-records-label>`.

.. _cart-label:

Cart
----------------

The cart is a temporary holding place for items in the OPAC and/or staff
client. The cart will be emptied once the session is ended (by closing
the browser or logging out). The cart is best used for performing batch
operations (holds, printing, emailing) or for getting a list of items to
be printed or emailed to yourself or a patron.

If you would like to enable the cart in the staff client, you need to
set the :ref:`intranetbookbag` system preference to
'Show.' To add things to the cart, search the catalog and select the
items you would like added to your cart and click on the 'Add to cart'
button.

|image878|

A confirmation will appear below the cart button at the top of the staff
client

|image879|

Clicking on the cart icon will provide you with the contents of the cart

|image880|

From this list of items you can perform several actions

-  'More details' will show more information about the items in the cart

-  'Send' will send the list to the email address you enter

-  'Download' will allow you to download the cart using one of 3 default
   formats or your :ref:`CSV Profiles`

-  'Print' will present you with a printable version of the cart

-  'Empty and close' will empty the list and close the window

-  'Hide window' will close the window

Modifying bibliographic records via the cart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bibliographic records can be modified in batch from the records added to a cart.
Select the records in the cart you wish to modify and click 'Batch modify'.

You will be taken to the 'Batch record modification tool' and from there the
process to modify the bibliographic records is the same as if you had chosen to
:ref:`modify via Tools <batch-record-modification-label>`.
