-  You can also choose how to sort the list

-  Next decide if your list is going to be private or public

   -  A private list is managed by you and can be seen only by you
      (depending on your permissions settings below)

   -  A public list can be seen by everybody, but managed only by you
      (depending on your permissions settings below)

-  Finally decide what your permissions will be on the list. You can allow
   or disallow:

   -  anyone else to add entries

   -  anyone to remove his own contributed entries

      -  **Note**

             The owner of a list is always allowed to add entries, but
             needs permission to remove.

Cart
----------------

The cart is a temporary holding place for items in the OPAC and/or staff
client. The cart will be emptied once the session is ended (by closing
the browser or logging out). The cart is best used for performing batch
operations (holds, printing, emailing) or for getting a list of items to
be printed or emailed to yourself or a patron.

If you would like to enable the cart in the staff client, you need to
set the :ref:`intranetbookbag` system preference to
'Show.' To add things to the cart, search the catalog and select the
items you would like added to your cart and choose 'Cart' from the 'Add
to' menu

|image878|

A confirmation will appear below the cart button at the top of the staff
client

|image879|

Clicking on the cart icon will provide you with the contents of the cart

|image880|

From this list of items you can perform several actions

-  'More details' will show more information about the items in the cart

-  'Send' will send the list to the email address you enter

-  'Download' will allow you to download the cart using one of 3 default
   formats or your :ref:`CSV Profiles`

-  'Print' will present you with a printable version of the cart

-  'Empty and close' will empty the list and close the window

-  'Hide window' will close the window
