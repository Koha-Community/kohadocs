Interlibrary loans
=====================

The interlibrary loans (ILL) module adds the ability to request and manage loans or copies of material from external sources.  Patrons submit a request form via the OPAC for review and processing by library staff.  Alternatively staff can place requests themselves from the staff client.  

Set up
-------------

Before using the ILL Requests module you will want to make sure that you have completed all of the set up.

The ILL module can be configured for different types of requests and workflows known as backends.   Currently available backends are documented on the Koha community wiki at https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/ILL_backends.  You will need to configure at least one backend.
