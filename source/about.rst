.. _server-information-label:

Server information
-------------------------------------

Under the **Server information** tab you will find information about the
Koha version and the machine you have installed Koha on. This
information is very important for debugging problems. When reporting
issues to your support provider or to the various other support avenues
(mailing lists, chat room, etc), it's always good to give the
information from this screen. The time zone is handled via Koha or
server configuration. For more information how to specify time zones per
instance, see
https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Time_Zone_Configuration

In order to take advantage of all of the functionalities of Koha, you
will need to keep your Perl modules up to date. The **Perl modules** tab
will show you all of the modules required by Koha, the version you have
installed and whether you need to upgrade certain modules.

upgraded.
