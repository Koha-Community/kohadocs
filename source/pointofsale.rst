Point of sale
===============================================================================

Point of sale is a module designed for selling items to people who aren't 
registered at the library or to make sales that do not need to be linked to a 
patron account.

For example, you can sell used books or promotional items. These items can be 
sold to anyone and you don't need to link the sale to a particular patron.

For invoices that need to be linked to a patron's account (like a lost item or 
new card fee), use :ref:`manual invoicing <creating-manual-invoices-label>`.
