Global system preferences
=========================

Global system preferences control the way your Koha system works in
general. Set these preferences before anything else in Koha.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Global System Preferences

|image0|

System preferences can be searched (using any part of the preference
name or description) using the search box on the 'Administration' page
or the search box at the top of each system preferences page.

|image1|

When editing preferences a ^(modified)^ tag will appear next to items
you change until you click the 'Save All' button:

|image2|

After saving your preferences you'll get a confirmation message telling
you what preferences were saved:

|image3|

Each section of preferences can be sorted alphabetically by clicking the
small down arrow to the right of the word 'Preference' in the header
column

|image4|

If the preference refers to monetary values (like
:ref:`maxoutstanding`) the currency displayed will be the
default you set in your :ref:`Currencies and Exchange Rates`
administration area. In the examples to
follow they will all read USD for U.S. Dollars.

    **Important**

    For libraries systems with unique URLs for each site the system
    preference can be overridden by editing your koha-http.conf file
    this has to be done by a system administrator or someone with access
    to your system files. For example if all libraries but one want to
    have search terms highlighted in results you set the
    OpacHighlightedWords preference to 'Highlight' then edit the
    koha-http.conf for the library that wants this turned off by adding
    'SetEnv OVERRIDE\_SYSPREF\_OpacHighlightedWords "0"'. After
    restarting the web server that one library will no longer see
    highlighted terms. Consult with your system administrator for more
    information.

-  This preference lets you decide when you'd like to create an item
   record in Koha. If you choose to add an item record when 'placing an
   order' then you will enter item information in as you place records
   in your basket. If you choose to add the item when 'receiving an
   order' you will be asked for item record information when you're
   receiving orders in acquisitions. If you choose to add the item when

   display in both the OPAC and the Staff Client/Intranet. If images of
   item types are disabled, text labels for item types will still appear
   in the OPAC and Staff Client.

.. _replytodefault-label:

ReplytoDefault
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use \_\_\_ as the email address that will be set as the replyto in
emails

Description:

send messages to their normal recipient)

Description:

-  This system preference is used to override any patron email address with this one
   when sending notices. This is meant to be used in a testing environment to
   test notices and to avoid spamming patrons.

  **Important**

  This is not to be used in a production environment. Otherwise, no patron

specified by their library (if any).

-  Set IP address range in the library administration area

   -  *Get there:* More > Administration > Basic Parameters > :ref:`Libraries <libraries-label>`

Values:

-  Don't require

-  Require

Description:

-  This preference protects the system by blocking unauthorized users
   from accessing the staff client program and settings. Authorized and
   unauthorized users are determined by their computer's IP addresses.
   When the preference is set to 'Require', IP authorization is in
   effect and unauthorized IP addresses will be blocked. This means that
   staff cannot work from home unless their IP address has been
   authorized. When set to 'Don't require', anyone with a staff client
   login will have access no matter which IP address they are using.

.. _independentbranches-label:

IndependentBranches

Default: Don't prevent

Asks: \_\_\_ staff (but not superlibrarians) from modifying objects
(holds, items, patrons, etc.) belonging to other libraries.

Values:

-  Don't prevent

-  Prevent

Description:

-  This preference should only be used by library systems which are
   sharing a single Koha installation among multiple branches but are
   considered independent organizations, meaning they do not share
   material or patrons with other branches and do not plan to change
   that in the future. If set to 'Prevent' it increases the security
   between library branches by: prohibiting staff users from logging
   into another branch from within the staff client, filtering out
   patrons from patron searches who are not a part of the login branch
   conducting the search, limiting the location choices to the login
   branch when adding or modifying an item record, preventing users from
   other branch locations from placing holds or checking out materials
   from library branches other than their own, and preventing staff from
   editing item records which belong to other library branches. All of
   these security safeguards can be overridden only by the
   superlibrarian, the highest level of privileges.

    **Important**

    It is important that this value be set before going live and that it
    NOT be changed

.. _independentbranchespatronmodifications-label:

.. _sessionrestrictionbyip-label:

SessionRestrictionByIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Enable

Asks: \_\_\_ check for change in remote IP address for session security.
Disable only when remote IP address changes frequently.

Values:

-  Disable

-  Enable

Description:

-  When this preference is set to 'Enable' Koha will log you out of the
   staff client if your IP address changes as a security measure. For
   some systems the IP address changes frequently so you'll want to set
   this preference to 'Disable' to prevent Koha from logging you out of
   the staff client every time that happens.

    **Important**

    This is meant to help those whose IP address changes several times
    during the day, setting this preference to 'Disable' is not
    recommended otherwise because it is removing important security
    features from your staff client.

.. _sessionstorage-label:

SessionStorage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: in the MySQL database

Asks: Store login session information \_\_\_

Values:

-  as temporary files

   data is stored in during web sessions.

.. _timeout-label:

timeout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 12000000

Asks: Automatically log out users after \_\_\_ seconds of inactivity.

Description:

-  This preference sets the length of time the Staff Client or OPAC
   accounts can be left inactive before re-logging in is necessary. The
   value of this preference is in seconds. At this time, the amount of
   time before a session times out must be the same for both the Staff
   Client and the OPAC.

Authorities

.. _authoritiesgeneral-label:

General
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _authdisplayhierarchy-label:

AuthDisplayHierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't display

Asks: \_\_\_ broader term/narrower term hierarchies when viewing
authorities.

Values:

-  Display

   |image14|

-  Don't display

Description:

-  If your authority records includes 5xx fields with linked references
   to broader and/or narrower see also references this preference will
   turn on a display of those authorities at the top of the record.

.. _authoritycontrolledindicators-label:

AuthorityControlledIndicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use the following text to edit how authority records control indicators
of attached biblio fields (and possibly subfield $2). Lines starting with a
comment symbol (#) are skipped. Each line should be of the form: (marc21|unimarc),
tag, ind1:(auth1|auth2|some_value), ind2:(auth1|auth2|thesaurus|some_value).
Here auth1 and auth2 refer to the indicators of the authority record, tag is a
biblio field number or an asterisk (*), and some_value is a fixed value
(one character). The MARC21 option thesaurus refers to indicators controlled by
authority field 008/11 and 040$f.

Description:

-  Used when merging authorities.

-  Controls how the indicators of linked authority records affect the
   corresponding biblio indicators. Currently, the default value is fine-tuned
   for MARC21 and copies the authority indicators for UNIMARC.

-  For example, a MARC21 field 100 in a biblio record should pick its first
   indicator from the linked authority record. The second indicator is not
   controlled by the authority. This report supports such MARC conventions.

.. _authoritymergelimit-label:

AuthorityMergeLimit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 50

Asks: When modifying an authority record, do not update attached biblio
records if the number exceeds \_\_\_ records. (Above this limit, the merge_authority
cron job will merge them.)

.. _authoritymergemode-label:

AuthorityMergeMode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: loose

Asks: When updating biblio records from an attached authority record ("merging"),
handle subfields of relevant biblio record fields in \_\_\_ mode. In strict mode
subfields that are not found in the authority record, are deleted. Loose mode
will keep them. Loose mode is the historical behavior and still the default.

Values:

-  loose

-  strict

.. _autocreateauthorities-label:

AutoCreateAuthorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: do not generate

Asks: When editing records, \_\_\_ authority records that are missing.

Values:

-  do not generate

-  generate

    **Important**

    `BiblioAddsAuthorities <#biblioaddsauthorities>`__ must be set to
    "allow" for this to have any effect

Description:

-  When this and `BiblioAddsAuthorities <#biblioaddsauthorities>`__ are
   both turned on, automatically create authority records for headings
   that don't have any authority link when cataloging. When
   BiblioAddsAuthorities is on and AutoCreateAuthorities is turned off,
   do not automatically generate authority records, but allow the user
   to enter headings that don't match an existing authority. When
   BiblioAddsAuthorities is off, this has no effect.

.. _biblioaddsauthorities-label:

BiblioAddsAuthorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: allow

Asks: When editing records, \_\_\_ them to automatically create new
authority records if needed, rather than having to reference existing
authorities.

Values:

-  allow

   -  This setting allows you to type values in the fields controlled by
      authorities and then adds a new authority if one does not exist

-  don't allow

   -  This setting will lock the authority controlled fields, forcing
      you to search for an authority versus allowing you to type the
      information in yourself.

.. _marcauthoritycontrolfield008-label:

MARCAuthorityControlField008
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: \|\| aca\|\|aabn \| a\|a d

Asks: Use the following text for the contents of MARC21 authority
control field 008 position 06-39 (fixed length data elements).

    **Important**

    Do not include the date (position 00-05) in this preference, Koha
    will calculate automatically and put that in before the values in
    this preference.

Description:

-  This preference controls the default value in the 008 field on
   Authority records. It does not effect bibliographic records.

.. _unimarcauthorityfield100-label:

UNIMARCAuthorityField100
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: afrey50 ba0

Asks: Use the following text for the contents of UNIMARC authority field
100 position (fixed length data elements).

    **Important**

    Do not include the date (position 00-07) in this preference, Koha
    will calculate automatically and put that in before the values in
    this preference.

Description:

-  This preference controls the default value in the 100 field on
   Authority records cataloged in UNIMARC. It does not effect
   bibliographic records.

.. _useauthoritiesfortracings-label:

UseAuthoritiesForTracings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ authority record numbers instead of text strings for
searches from subject tracings.

Values:

-  Don't use

   -  Search links look for subject/author keywords (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=su:Business%20networks)

-  Use

   -  Search links look for an authority record (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=an:354)

Description:

-  For libraries that have authority files, they may want to make it so
   that when a link to an authorized subject or author is clicked on the
   OPAC or staff client it takes the searcher only to a list of results
   with that authority record. Most libraries do not have complete
   authority files and so setting this preference to 'Don't use' will
   allow searchers to click on links to authors and subject headings and
   perform a keyword search against those fields, finding all possible
   relevant results instead.

.. _linker-label:

Linker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These preferences will control how Koha links bibliographic records to
authority records. All bibliographic records added to Koha after these
preferences are set will link automatically to authority records, for
records added before these preferences are set there is a script
(misc/link\_bibs\_to\_authorities.pl) that your system administrator can
run to link records together.

.. _catalogmodulerelink-label:

CatalogModuleRelink
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ automatically relink headings that have previously been
linked when saving records in the cataloging module.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  Longtime users of Koha don't expect the authority and bib records to
   link consistently. This preference makes it possible to disable
   authority relinking in the cataloging module only (i.e. relinking is
   still possible if link\_bibs\_to\_authorities.pl is run). Note that
   though the default behavior matches the previous behavior of Koha
   (retaining links to outdated authority records), it does not match
   the intended behavior (updating biblio/authority link after
   bibliographic record is edited). Libraries that want the intended
   behavior of authority control rather than the way Koha used to handle
   linking should set CatalogModuleRelink to 'Do'. Once setting this to
   'Do' the following preferences can also be set.

.. _linkerkeepstale-label:

LinkerKeepStale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ keep existing links to authority records for headings where
the linker is unable to find a match.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  When set to 'Do', the linker will never remove a link to an authority
   record, though, depending on the value of
   :ref:`LinkerRelink`, it may change the link.

.. _linkermodule-label:

LinkerModule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Default

Asks: Use the \_\_\_ linker module for matching headings to authority
records.

Values:

-  Default

   -  Retains Koha's previous behavior of only creating links when there
      is an exact match to one and only one authority record; if the
      :ref:`LinkerOptions` preference is set to
      'broader\_headings', it will try to link headings to authority
      records for broader headings by removing subfields from the end of
      the heading

-  First match

   -  Creates a link to the first authority record that matches a given
      heading, even if there is more than one authority record that
      matches

-  Last match

   -  Creates a link to the last authority record that matches a given
      heading, even if there is more than one record that matches

Description:

-  This preference tells Koha which match to use when searching for
   authority matches when saving a record.

.. _linkeroptions-label:

LinkerOptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Set the following options for the authority linker \_\_\_

    **Important**

    This feature is experimental and shouldn't be used in a production
    environment until further expanded upon.

Description:

-  This is a pipe separated (\|) list of options. At the moment, the
   only option available is "broader\_headings." With this option set to
   "broader\_headings", the linker will try to match the following
   heading as follows:

   ::

       =600 10$aCamins-Esakov, Jared$xCoin collections$vCatalogs$vEarly works to 1800.

   First: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections--Catalogs--Early works
   to 1800

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections--Catalogs

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared (matches! if a previous attempt had
   matched, it would not have tried this)

.. _linkerrelink-label:

LinkerRelink
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do

Asks: \_\_\_ relink headings that have previously been linked to
authority records.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  When set to 'Do', the linker will confirm the links for headings that
   have previously been linked to an authority record when it runs,
   correcting any incorrect links it may find. When set to 'Do not', any
   heading with an existing link will be ignored, even if the existing
   link is invalid or incorrect.

.. _acquisitiondetails-label:

AcquisitionDetails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Display

Asks: \_\_\_ acquisition details on the biblio detail page.

Values:

-  Display

-  Don't display

Description:

-  This preference controls whether a tab will show on the detail page
   in the staff client that includes detailed acquisitions information
   for the title. This tab will include links to order information
   stored in the acquisitions module.

   |image1180|

.. _authorityseparator-label:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: --

Asks: Separate multiple displayed authors, series or subjects with
\_\_\_.

.. _hide-marc-label:

hide\_marc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Display

Asks: \_\_\_ MARC tag numbers, subfield codes and indicators in MARC
views.

Values:

-  Display -- shows the tag numbers on the cataloging interface

   |image15|

-  Don't display -- shows just descriptive text when cataloging

   |image16|

.. _intranetbibliodefaultview-label:

IntranetBiblioDefaultView
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: ISBD form

Asks: By default, display biblio records in \_\_\_

Values:

-  ISBD form -- displays records in the staff client in the old card
   catalog format

   -  See :ref:`ISBD` preference for more information

-  Labelled MARC form -- displays records in the staff client in MARC
   with text labels to explain the different fields

-  MARC form -- displays records in the staff client in MARC

-  normal form -- visual display in the staff client (for the average
   person)

Description:

-  This setting determines the bibliographic record display when
   searching the catalog on the staff client. This setting does not
   affect the display in the OPAC which is changed using the
   :ref:`BiblioDefaultView` preference under the OPAC
   preference tab. This setting changes the look of the record when
   first displayed. The MARC and ISBD views can still be seen by
   clicking in the sidebar.

.. _isbd-label:

ISBD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: See `ISBD view configuration
<https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/ISBD_view_configuration>` on the wiki.

Asks: Use the following as the ISBD template:

Description:

-  This determines how the ISBD information will display in the staff
   client. Elements in the list can be reordered to produce a different
   ISBD view. ISBD, the International Standard Bibliographic
   Description, was first introduced by IFLA (International Federation
   of Library Associations) in 1969 in order to provide guidelines for
   descriptive cataloging. The purpose of ISBD is to aid the
   international exchange of bibliographic records for a variety of
   materials.

.. _labelmarcview-label:

LabelMARCView
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't

Asks: \_\_\_ collapse repeated tags of the same type into one tag entry.

Values:

-  Do -- will combine all identical tag numbers under one heading in the
   MARC view in the OPAC and Staff Client

   |image17|

-  Don't -- will list all of the tags individually in the MARC view in
   the OPAC and Staff Client

   |image18|

.. _marcfielddocurl-label:

MARCFieldDocURL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: blank

Asks: Use \_\_\_ as the URL for MARC field documentation. Possible substitutions are {MARC} (marc flavour, eg. "MARC21" or "UNIMARC"), {FIELD} (field number, eg. "000" or "048"), {LANG} (user language, eg. "en" or "fi-FI"). If left empty, the format documentation on http://loc.gov (MARC21) or http://archive.ifla.org (UNIMARC) is used. For example http://fielddoc.example.com/?marc={MARC}&field={FIELD}&language={LANG}

Description:

-  This preference lets you choose the source of the MARC documentation available through the "?" next to MARC fields.

.. _mergereportfields-label:

MergeReportFields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ fields to display for deleted records after merge

Description:

-  When merging records together you can receive a report of the merge
   process once it's done, this preference lets you set the default
   values for this report.

Example: '001,245ab,600' displays:

-  value of 001

-  subfields a and b of fields 245

-  all subfields of fields 600

.. _notesblacklist-label:

NotesBlacklist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Don't show these \_\_\_ note fields in title notes separator (OPAC
record details) and in the description separator (Staff client record
details).

Description:

-  This preference lets you define which of your note fields are hidden
   from the title notes (OPAC) and descriptions (Staff) tabs. Enter the
   values as a comma separated list. For example to hide the local note
   and the bibliography note in MARC21 enter 504, 590.

.. _opacsuppression-preferences-label:

OpacSuppression, OpacSuppressionByIPRange, OpacSuppressionRedirect, and OpacSuppressionMessage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpacSuppression Default: Don't hide

Asks: \_\_\_ items marked as suppressed from OPAC search results.
Restrict the suppression to IP addressesoutside of the IP range \_\_\_
(Leave blank if not used. Define a range like 192.168..) Redirect the opac detail
page for suppressed records to \_\_\_ Display the following message on
the redirect page for suppressed biblios \_\_\_.

OpacSuppression Values:

-  Don't hide

   -  Will show records in OPAC search results if they are marked
      suppressed

-  Hide

   -  Will not show records in OPAC search results if they're marked as
      suppressed

OpacSuppressionRedirect Values:

-  an explanatory page ('This record is blocked').

-  the 404 error page ('Not found').

Description:

-  These preferences control hiding of bibliographic records from
   display in the OPAC. Each bibliographic record you want to hide from
   the OPAC simply needs to have the value "1" in the field mapped with
   Suppress index (942$n field in MARC21, no official field in UNIMARC).
   The indexer then hides it from display in OPAC but will still display
   it in the Staff Client. If you want to further control suppression
   you can set an IP address range to still show suppressed items to.
   Define a range like 192.168.. If you don't want to limit suppression
   in this way, leave the IP field blank. You can also decide what the
   patrons will see in the OPAC when a title is suppressed by setting
   the OpacSuppressionRedirect and OpacSuppressionMessage preferences.
   You can either show the patron a 404 page if they try to see a
   suppressed record or you can create a custom page by entering the
   HTML in the OpacSuppressionMessage part of this preference.

       **Note**

       An :ref:`authorized value <authorized-values-label>` for the MARC21 942$n
       field (or the equivalent UNIMARC field) should be set to
       eliminate errors. One example would be to create an authorized
       value titled SUPPRESS with a value of 0 for don't suppress and 1
       for suppress.

    **Important**

    If this preference is set to 'hide' and you have the 942n field set
    to 1, it will hide the entire bib record - not just an individual
    item.

    **Note**

    Suppressed records will show a note in the staff client indicating
    that they are suppressed from view in the OPAC.

    |image1181|

    This note can be styled by using the
    :ref:`IntranetUserCSS` preference to stand out more
    if you'd like.

    |image1182|

.. _separateholdings-and-separateholdingsbranch-label:

SeparateHoldings and SeparateHoldingsBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SeparateHoldings default: Don't separate

SeparateHoldingsBranch default: home library

Asks: \_\_\_ items display into two tabs, where the first tab contains
items whose \_\_\_ is the logged in user's library. The second tab will
contain all other items.

SeparateHoldings values:

-  Don't separate

-  Separate

SeparateHoldingsBranch values:

-  holding library

-  home library

Description:

-  This preference lets you decide if you would like to have the holding
   information on the bibliographic detail page in the staff client
   split in to multiple tabs. The default is to show all holdings on one
   tab.

   |image19|

.. _urllinktext-label:

URLLinkText
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Online Resource

Asks: Show \_\_\_ as the text of links embedded in MARC records.

Description:

-  If the 856 field does not have a subfield 3 or y defined, the OPAC
   will say 'Click here to access online.^ If you would like the field
   to say something else enter that in this field.

.. _usecontrolnumber-label:

UseControlNumber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ record control number ($w subfields) and control number
(001) for linking of bibliographic records.

Values:

-  Don't use

   -  When clicking on links to titles that appear next to 'Continues'
      and 'Continued by' in the detail display Koha will perform a title
      search

-  Use

   -  When clicking on links to titles that appear next to 'Continues'
      and 'Continued by' in the detail display Koha will perform a
      control number (MARC field 001) search

    **Important**

    Unless you are going in and manually changing 773$w to match your
    rigorously-defined bibliographic relationships, you should set this
    preference to "Don't use" and instead set
    :ref:`EasyAnalyticalRecords` to "Display"

Description:

-  If you have a serial called "Journal of Interesting Things" which has
   a separate record from when it was called "Transactions of the
   Interesting Stuff Society," you could add linking fields to indicate
   the relationship between the two records. UseControlNumber allows you
   to use your local accession numbers for those links. In MARC21, the
   relevant sections of the two records might look like this:

   ::

           =001    12345
           =110  2_$aInteresting Stuff Society.
           =245  10$aTransactions of the Interesting Stuff Society.
           =785  00$aInteresting Stuff Society$tJournal of Interesting Things.$w12346

           =001    12346
           =110  2_$aInteresting Stuff Society.
           =245  10$aJournal of Interesting Things.
           =780  00$aInteresting Stuff Society$tTransactions of the Interesting Stuff Society.$w12345

   With UseControlNumber set to 'Use', the 78x links will use the
   Control Numbers is subfield $w, instead of doing a title search on
   "Journal of Interesting Things" and "Transactions of the Interesting
   Stuff Society" respectively.

to match aggressively by trying all variations of the ISBNs in the
imported record as a phrase in the ISBN fields of already cataloged
records.

Values:

-  do

-  don't

Description:

-  This preference allows you to choose to alter the ISBN matching rule
   used when staging records for import to be more aggressive. This
   means that all text will be stripped from the ISBN field so that a
   pure number match is possible. If this preference is set to "Don't"
   then Koha will find a match only if the ISBN fields are identical.

    **Important**

    Note that this preference has no effect if
    :ref:`UseQueryParser` is on.

.. _aggressivematchonissn-label:

    :ref:`UseControlNumber` preference is set to "Don't
    use" or else the "Show analytics" links in the staff client and the
    OPAC will be broken.

Description:

-  An analytic entry in a catalog is one that describes a part of a
   larger work that is also described in the catalog. In bibliographic
   cataloging, analytic entries may be made for chapters in books or
   special issues of articles in periodicals. In archival cataloging,
   analytic entries may be made for series or items within a collection.
   This feature in Koha allows for an easy way of linking analytic
   entries to the host records, and this system preference adds several
   new menu options to the staff cataloging detail pages to allow that
   to happen.

.. _enableadvancedcatalogingeditor-label:

EnableAdvancedCatalogingEditor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ the advanced cataloging editor.

Description:

-  This preference will allow you to choose between a basic editor and a
   advanced editor for cataloging.

    **Note**

    This feature does not currently include any support for
    UNIMARC or NORMARC fixed fields.

.. _alternateholdingsfield-and-alternateholdingsseparator-label:

AlternateHoldingsField and AlternateHoldingsSeparator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Display MARC subfield \_\_\_ as holdings information for records
that do not have items, with the subfields separated by \_\_\_.

Description:

-  Sometimes libraries migrate to Koha with their holding info in the
   852 field (OCLC holdings information field) and choose not to
   transfer that information into the 952 (Koha holdings information
   field) because they don't plan on circulating those items. For those
   libraries or other libraries that have data in the 852 fields of
   their records that they want to display, these preferences let you
   choose to display holdings info from a field other than the 952
   field. The AlternateHoldingsField preference can contain multiple
   subfields to look in; for instance 852abhi would look in 852
   subfields a, b, h, and i.

-  With AlternateHoldingsField set to 852abhi and
   AlternateHoldingsSeparator set to a space the holdings would look
   like the following:

-  generated in the form <year>-0001, <year>-0002

-  generated in the form 1, 2, 3

-  incremental EAN-13 barcodes

-  not generated automatically

Description:

-  This setting is for libraries wishing to generate barcodes from
   within Koha (as opposed to scanning in pre-printed barcodes or
   manually assigning them). The default behavior makes it so that when
   you click in the barcode field (952$p in MARC21) it will populate
   with the automatic barcode you have chosen. If you would rather it
   only enter an automatic barcode when you click on the plugin (the ...
   to the right of the field) you can change the plugin used for that
   field in the framework. Set the plugin for 952$p (if using MARC21 or
   equivalent field mapped to items.barcode in your local MARC format)
   for your frameworks to barcode\_manual.pl instead of barcode.pl.
   Learn more about editing frameworks under the :ref:`MARC Bibliographic
   Frameworks <marc-bibliographic-frameworks-label>` section of this manual.

Values:

-  biblio record

-  specific item

Description:

-  This preference determines whether the item type Koha uses for
   issuing rules will be an attribute of the bibliographic record or the
   item record. Most libraries refer to the item record for item types.
   It also determines if the item type icon appears on the OPAC search
   results. If you have the preference set to 'biblio record' then Koha
   displays the item type icon on the search results to the left of the

Default: 082ab

Asks: Map the MARC subfield to an item's callnumber.

    **Note**

    This can contain multiple subfields to look in; for instance 082ab
    would look in 082 subfields a and b.

Description:

-  This setting determines which MARC field will be used to determine
   the call number that will be entered into item records automatically
   (952$o). The value is set by providing the MARC field code (050, 082,
   090, 852 are all common in MARC21) and the subfield codes without the
   delimiters ($a, $b would be ab).

Examples:

-  Dewey: 082ab or 092ab; LOC: 050ab or 090ab; from the item record:
   852hi

   restrict checkout based on age. These restrictions can be overridden
   by the :ref:`AgeRestrictionOverride`
   preference. Enter in this field a series of keywords separated by bar
   (\|) with no spaces. For example PG\|R\|E\|EC\|Age\| will look for PG
   followed by an age number, R folllowed by an age number, Age followed
   by an age number, and so on. These values can appear in any MARC
   field, but Library of Congress recommends the 521$a (Target Audience
   Note). Whatever field you decide to use you must map the word
   agerestriction in the biblioitems table to that field in the :ref:`Koha to
   MARC Mapping <koha-to-marc-mapping-label>`. When cataloging you can enter
   values like PG 13 or E 10 in the 521$a and Koha will then notify
   circulation librarians that the material may not be recommended for
   the patron based on their age.

       **Important**

       You must map the word agerestriction in the biblioitems table to
       the MARC field where this information will appear via the :ref:`Koha

       **Important**

       This will only effect records without a subscription attached.

.. _allownotforloanoverride-label:

AllowNotForLoanOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override and check out items that are marked as
not for loan.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which controls the ability of
   staff (patrons will always be prevented from checking these items
   out) to check out items that are marked as "not for loan". Setting it
   to "Allow" would allow such items to be checked out, setting it to
   "Don't allow" would prevent this. This setting determines whether
   items meant to stay in the library, such as reference materials, and
   other library resources can be checked out by patrons.

.. _allowrenewallimitoverride-label:

AllowRenewalLimitOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to manually override the renewal limit and renew a
checkout when it would go over the renewal limit.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which controls the ability of
   staff to override the limits placed on the number of times an item
   can be renewed. Setting it to "Allow" would allow such limits to be
   overridden, setting it to "Don't allow" would prevent this. This is a
   preference in which if it is set to "allow" it would allow the
   library staff to use their judgment for overriding the renew limit
   for special cases, setting it to "Don't allow" prevents an
   opportunity for abuse by the library staff.

.. _allowrenewalonholdoverride-label:

AllowRenewalOnHoldOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to renew items that are on hold by manually specifying a due date.

Default: Don't allow

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

- This preference enables items that are on hold to be renewed with a due date specified by the user.

  It can appear in two locations:

  1. In the "Checkouts" table on the Patron Details screen. It is possible to select on loan items that would otherwise fulfil a hold request to be renewed. When such an item is selected, an additional date selection box is displayed to allow the user to specify the due date for all on hold items that are to be renewed.

  2. In the Circulation > Renew alert screen. When a barcode of an on loan item that would ordinarily fulfil a hold request is entered, the usual alert is displayed indicating that the item is on hold, it is still possible to override this, and renew. With this preference enabled it is also possible to specify a due date.

.. _allowreturntobranch-label:

AllowReturnToBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: to any library

Asks: Allow materials to be returned to \_\_\_

Values:

-  either the library the item is from or the library it was checked out
   from.

-  only the library the item is from.

-  only the library the item was checked out from.

-  to any library.

Description:

-  This preference lets the library system decide how they will accept
   returns. Some systems allow for items to be returned to any library
   in the system (the default value of this preference) others want to
   limit item returns to only specific branches. This preference will
   allow you to limit item returns (checkins) to the branch(es) set in
   the value.

.. _allowtoomanyoverride-label:

AllowTooManyOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override and check out items when the patron has
reached the maximum number of allowed checkouts.

Values:

-  Allow

   |image27|

-  Don't allow

   |image28|

Description:

-  If this preference is set to "Allow" then staff all will be presented
   with an option to checkout more items to a patron than are normally
   allowed in the :ref:`Circulation and fines rules`. If
   this preference is set to "Don't allow" then no staff member will be
   able to check out more than the circulation limit.

.. _automaticitemreturn-label:

AutomaticItemReturn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do

Asks: \_\_\_ automatically transfer items to their home branch when they
are returned.

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether an item
   is returned to its home branch automatically or not. If set to
   "Don't", the staff member checking an item in at a location other
   than the item's home branch will be asked whether the item will
   remain at the non-home branch (in which case the new location will be
   marked as a holding location) or returned. Setting it to "Do" will
   ensure that items checked in at a branch other than their home branch
   will be sent to that home branch.

.. _autoremoveoverduesrestrictions-label:

AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ allow OVERDUES restrictions triggered by sent notices to be
cleared automatically when all overdue items are returned by a patron.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  Using the :ref:`Overdue Notice/Status Triggers` you
   can restrict patrons after they receive an overdue notice. This
   preference lets you define whether Koha will automatically remove
   that restriction once the overdue items in question are returned or
   not.

.. _autoreturncheckedoutitems-label:

AutoReturnCheckedOutItems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ require librarians to manually confirm a checkout where the item
is already checked out to another patron.

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Default: Do

Description:

-  This preference controls whether Koha asks for a confirmation when trying
   to check out an item that is already checked out to another patron.

-  Set to 'Do', Koha will ask the staff member to confirm the check out.

   |image1433|

-  Set to 'Don't', Koha will simply return the item from the previous
   patron's file and check it out to the actual patron and show a message.

   |image1434|

.. _circcontrol-label:

CircControl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: the library the item is from

Asks: Use the checkout and fines rules of \_\_\_

Values:

-  the library the item is from

   -  The :ref:`circulation and fines policies <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`
      will be determined by the item's library where :ref:`HomeOrHoldingBranch`
      chooses if item's home library is used or holding library is used.

-  the library the patron is from

   -  The :ref:`circulation and fines policies <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`
      will be determined the patron's home library

-  the library you are logged in at

   -  The :ref:`circulation and fines policies <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` will be
      determined by the library that checked the item out to the patron

.. _consideronsitecheckoutsasnormalcheckouts-label:

ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Consider

Asks: \_\_\_ on-site checkouts as normal checkouts. If enabled, the
number of checkouts allowed will be normal checkouts + on-site
checkouts. If disabled, both values will be checked separately.

Values:

-  Consider

-  Don't consider

Description:

-  This preference allows you to decide if checkouts that are
   :ref:`OnSiteCheckouts` are counted toward the total
   checkouts a patron can have. You can also set your :ref:`circulation and
   fines rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` to allow only a certain number of
   normal and OnSite checkouts.

.. _defaultlongoverduechargevalue-label:

DefaultLongOverdueChargeValue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Charge a lost item to the borrower's account when the LOST value
of the item changes to \_\_\_

Description:

-  Leave this field empty if you don't want to charge the user for lost
   items. If you want the user to be charged enter the `LOST authorized
   value <#lost>`__ you are using in the
   :ref:`DefaultLongOverdueLostValue <defaultlongoverduelostvalue-and-defaultlongoverduedays-label>`
   preference. This preference is used when the :ref:`longoverdue cron
   job <cron-long-overdues-label>` is called without the --charge parameter.

.. _defaultlongoverduelostvalue-and-defaultlongoverduedays-label:

DefaultLongOverdueLostValue and DefaultLongOverdueDays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: By default, set the LOST value of an item to \_\_\_ when the item
has been overdue for more than \_\_\_ days.

Description:

-  These preferences are used when the :ref:`longoverdue cron
   job <cron-long-overdues-label>` is called without the --lost parameter. It
   allows users to set the values of the :ref:`longoverdue
   cron <cron-long-overdues-label>` without having to edit the crontab.
   Setting the values to 1 and 30 for example will mark the item with
   the `LOST authorized value <#lost>`__ of 1 after the item is 30 days
   overdue.

.. _holdsinnoissuescharge-label:

HoldsInNoissuesCharge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't include

Asks: \_\_\_ hold charges when summing up charges for noissuescharge.

Values:

-  Don't include

-  Include

.. _homeorholdingbranch-label:

HomeOrHoldingBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: the library the item was checked out from

Asks: Use the checkout and fines rules of \_\_\_

Values:

-  the library the item is from

   -  This is equivalent to 'home library'

-  the library the item was checked out from

   -  This is equivalent to 'holding library'

Description:

-  This preference does several things.

   -  If :ref:`CircControl` is set to 'the library the item
      is from' then the :ref:`circulation and fines
      policies <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` will be determined by the item's
      library where HomeOrHoldingBranch chooses if item's home library
      is used or holding library is used.

   -  If :ref:`IndependentBranches` is set to
      'Prevent' then the value of this preference is used in figuring
      out if the item can be checked out. If the item's home library
      does not match the logged in library, the item cannot be checked
      out unless you are a :ref:`superlibrarian <patron-permissions-defined-label>`.

    **Important**

    It is not recommend that this setting be changed after initial setup
    of Koha because it will change the behavior of items already checked
    out.

.. _issuelostitem-label:

IssueLostItem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: display a message

Asks: When issuing an item that has been marked as lost, \_\_\_.

Values:

-  display a message

   |image29|

-  do nothing

   -  This option will just check the item out without notifying you
      that the item was marked lost.

-  require confirmation

   |image30|

Description:

-  This preference lets you define how library staff are notified that
   an item with a lost status is being checked out. This will help staff
   mark items as 'available' if you choose to 'display a message' or
   'require confirmation.^ If you choose to 'do nothing,^ there will be
   no notification that the item being checked out is marked as 'lost.^

.. _issuinginprocess-label:

IssuingInProcess
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't prevent

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons from checking out an item whose rental charge would
take them over the limit.

Values:

-  Don't prevent

-  Prevent

Description:

-  This preference determines if a patron can check items out if there
   is an overdue fine on the account and any of the materials the patron
   wishes to check out will potentially tip the account balance over the
   maximum fines policy the library has in place.

Example: Your library has a $5 limit set for 'fines' (ie, after
incurring $5 in fines, a patron can no longer check out items). A patron
comes to the desk with 5 items to check out (4 books and a video) The
patron has $4 in charges already on their account. One of the videos has
a rental charge of $1, therefore making the total fines on the patron's
account suddenly $5 (the limit).

.. _itemsdeniedrenewal-label:

ItemsDeniedRenewal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Define custom rules to deny specific items from renewal.

Description:

-  This preference allows you to specify items that should not be renewed
   either from the OPAC or staff client.  You can enter any combination of
   fields (from the items table in the Koha database) followed by a colon
   then a space then a bracketed list of values separated by commas. e.g:

   ::

       ccode: [NEWFIC,NULL,DVD]
       itype: [NEWBK,""]

-  The word 'NULL' can be used to block renewal on undefined fields,
   while an empty string "" will block on an empty (but defined) field.

    **Note**

    If using automatic renewal notices your notice text should be updated to
    account for the new reason that renewals may be denied "item_denied_renewal".

.. _maninvinnoissuescharge-label:

ManInvInNoissuesCharge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Include

Asks: \_\_\_ custom debit types when summing up charges for
noissuescharge.

Values:

-  Don't include

-  Include

Description:

-  This preference lets you decide if charges entered as manual invoices
   are included when calculating the
   :ref:`noissuescharge`. If this is set to 'Include' then
   Koha will include all manual invoices when deciding if the patron
   owes too much money to check anything else out of the library. If
   it's set to 'Don't include' then Koha will ignore all manual invoice
   charges when figuring out if the patron owes too much money to
   checkout additional materials.

.. _marklostitemsasreturned-label:

Default: 5

Asks: Prevent patrons from checking out books if they have more than
\_\_\_ USD in fines.

Description:

-  This preference is the maximum amount of money owed to the library
   before the user is banned from borrowing more items. Using the
   :ref:`ManInvInNoissuesCharge` and
   :ref:`RentalsInNoissuesCharge` preferences
   you can control which types of charges are considered in this total.
   This also coincides with :ref:`maxoutstanding` that
   limits patrons from placing holds when the maximum amount is owed to
   the library.

.. _noissueschargeguarantees-label:

NoIssuesChargeGuarantees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Prevent a patron from checking out if the patron has guarantees
owing in total more than \_\_\_ USD in fines.

transfer has not been received \_\_\_ days after it is sent.

Description:

-  The TransferMaxDaysWarning preference is set at a default number of
   days. This preference allows for a warning to appear after a set
   amount of time if an item being transferred between library branches
   has not been received. The warning will appear in the :ref:`Transfers to
   Receive <transfers-to-receive-label>` report.

.. _usebranchtransferlimits-and-branchtransferlimitstype-label:

UseBranchTransferLimits and BranchTransferLimitsType
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

UseBranchTransferLimits Values:

-  Don't enforce

-  Enforce

BranchTransferLimitsType Values:

-  collection code

-  item type

BranchTransferLimitsType Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which determines whether items are
   transferred according to item type or collection code. This value
   determines how the library manager is able to restrict what items can
   be transferred between the branches.

.. _usedaysmode-label:

useDaysMode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't include

Asks: Calculate the due date using \_\_\_.

Values:

-  circulation rules only.

-  the calendar to push the due date to the next open day.

-  the calendar to skip all days the library is closed.

-  the calendar to push the due date to the next open matching weekday 
   for weekly loan periods, or the next open day otherwise (Note: This preference 
   setting only works with loan periods in multiples of 7).

Description:

-  This preference controls how scheduled library closures affect the
   due date of a material. The 'the calendar to skip all days the
   library is closed' setting allows for a scheduled closure not to
   count as a day in the loan period, the 'circulation rules only'
   setting would not consider the scheduled closure at all, and 'the
   calendar to push the due date to the next open day' would only effect
   the due date if the day the item is due would fall specifically on
   the day of closure.  The final option to use 'the calendar to push 
   the due date to the next open matching weekday for weekly loan periods, or the 
   next open day otherwise' allows libraries to accommodate patrons who may 
   only be able to visit the library on a certain day of the week, such as 
   part-time students or patrons who rely on public transport. 

Example:

-  The library has put December 24th and 25th in as closures on the
   calendar. A book checked out by a patron has a due date of December
   25th according to the circulation and fine rules. If this preference
   is set to 'circulation rules only' then the item will remain due on
   the 25th. If the preference is set to 'the calendar to push the due
   date to the next open day' then the due date will be December 26th.
   If the preference is set to 'the calendar to skip all days the
   library is closed' then the due date will be pushed to the 27th of
   December to accommodate for the two closed days.  If the preference is set 
   to 'the calendar to push the due date to the next open matching weekday 
   for weekly loan periods, or the next open day otherwise' the item would be 
   due back on January 1st.  If January 1st was also a closed day then 
   the item would be due back on the next available open day. 

The calendar is defined on a branch by branch basis. To learn more about
the calendar, check out the :ref:`Calendar & Holidays <calendar-label>`
section of this manual.

.. _usetransportcostmatrix-label:

UseTransportCostMatrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ Transport Cost Matrix for calculating optimal holds filling
between branches.

Values:

-  Don't use

-  Use

Description:

-  If the system is configured to use the :ref:`Transport cost
   matrix <transport-cost-matrix-label>` for filling holds, then when
   attempting to fill a hold, the system will search for the lowest cost
   branch, and attempt to fill the hold with an item from that branch
   first. Branches of equal cost will be selected from randomly. The
   branch or branches of the next highest cost shall be selected from
   only if all the branches in the previous group are unable to fill the
   hold.

   The system will use the item's current holding branch when
   determining whether the item can fulfill a hold using the Transport
   Cost Matrix.

.. _course-reserves-system-preferences-label:

   specific course.

.. _fines-policy-label:

Fines Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _finescalendar-label:

finesCalendar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: not including the days the library is closed

Asks: Calculate fines based on days overdue \_\_\_

Values:

-  directly

-  not including the days the library is closed

Description:

-  This preference will determine whether or not fines will be accrued
   during instances when the library is closed. Examples include
   holidays, library in-service days, etc. Choosing "not including the
   days the library is closed" setting will enable Koha to access its
   :ref:`Calendar` module and be considerate of dates when
   the library is closed. To make use of this setting the administrator
   must first access Koha's calendar and mark certain days as "holidays"
   ahead of time.

The calendar is defined on a branch by branch basis. To learn more about
the calendar, check out the :ref:`calendar <calendar-label>`
section of this manual.

.. _finesincludegraceperiod-label:

FinesIncludeGracePeriod
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Include

Asks: \_\_\_ the grace period when calculating the fine for an overdue
item.

Values:

-  Don't include

-  Include

Description:

-  This preference lets you control how Koha calculates fines when there
   is a grace period. If you choose to include the grace period when
   calculating fines then Koha will charge for the days in the grace
   period should the item be overdue more than those days. If you choose
   not to include the grace period then Koha will only charge for the
   days overdue after the grace period.

.. _finesmode-label:

finesMode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Calculate (but only for mailing to the admin)

Asks: \_\_\_ fines

Values:

-  Calculate (but only for mailing to the admin)

-  Calculate and charge

-  Don't calculate

    **Important**

    Requires that you have the fines cron job running
    (misc/cronjobs/fines.pl)

.. _holdfeemode-label:

HoldFeeMode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: only if all items are checked out and the record has at least one hold already.

Asks: Charge a hold fee \_\_\_

Values:

-  any time a hold is collected.

-  any time a hold is placed.

-  only if all items are checked out and the record has at least one hold already.

.. _processingfeenote-label:

ProcessingFeeNote
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Set the text to be recorded in the column 'note', table 'accountlines' when the processing fee (defined in item type) is applied.

.. _refundlostonreturncontrol-label:

RefundLostOnReturnControl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: check-in library.

Asks: If a lost item is returned, apply the refunding rules defined
in the \_\_\_

Values:

-  check-in library.

-  item holding branch.

-  item home branch.

.. _suspensionscalendar-label:

SuspensionsCalendar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: not including the days the library is closed

Asks: Calculate suspension expiration based on days overdue \_\_\_

Values:

-  directly

-  not including the days the library is closed

Description:

-  This system preference determines whether the :ref:`calendar <calendar-label>` is taken into 
   account when making suspension calculations.  Suspension rules can be 
   configured within the :ref:`circulation rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`.  
   If set to ‘directly’ the suspension period will ignore any closed days 
   that have been added to the calendar.  If set to ‘not including the 
   days the library is closed’ any days marked as closed within the calendar 
   will be skipped when calculating the end date for the suspension.

.. _usedefaultreplacementcost-label:

useDefaultReplacementCost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ the default replacement cost defined in item type.

Values:

-  Don't use

-  Use

Description:

-  This preference enables the use of the replacement cost set on the item type level

.. _whenlostchargereplacementfee-label:

WhenLostChargeReplacementFee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Charge

Asks: \_\_\_ the replacement price when a patron loses an item.

Values:

-  Charge

-  Don't charge

Description:

-  This preference lets you tell Koha what to do with an item is marked
   lost. If you want Koha can 'Charge' the patron the replacement fee
   listed on the item they lost or it can do nothing in reference to the
   patron and just mark the item lost in the catalog.

.. _whenlostforgivefine-label:

WhenLostForgiveFine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't forgive

Asks: \_\_\_ the fines on an item when it is lost.

Values:

-  Don't forgive

-  Forgive

Description:

-  This preference allows the library to decide if fines are charged in
   addition to the replacement fee when an item is marked as lost. If
   this preference is set to 'Forgive' then the patron won't be charged
   fines in addition to the replacement fee.

.. _holds-policy-label:

Holds Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _allowholddateinfuture-label:

AllowHoldDateInFuture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold requests to be placed that do not enter the waiting
list until a certain future date.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _allowholditemtypeselection-label:

AllowHoldItemTypeSelection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold fulfillment to be limited by itemtype.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _allowholdpolicyoverride-label:

AllowHoldPolicyOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override hold policies when placing holds.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which controls whether or not the
   library staff can override the circulation and fines rules as they
   pertain to the placement of holds. Setting this value to "Don't
   allow" will prevent anyone from overriding, setting it to "Allow"
   will allow it. This setting is important because it determines how
   strict the libraries rules for placing holds are. If this is set to
   "Allow", exceptions can be made for patrons who are otherwise
   normally in good standing with the library, but there is opportunity
   for the staff to abuse this function. If it is set to "Don't allow",
   no abuse of the system is possible, but it makes the system entirely
   inflexible in respect to holds.

.. _allowholdsondamageditems-label:

AllowHoldsOnDamagedItems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold requests to be placed on damaged items.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which controls whether or not hold
   requests can be placed on items that are marked as "damaged" (items
   are marked as damaged by editing subfield 4 on the item record).
   Setting this value to "Don't allow" will prevent anyone from placing
   a hold on such items, setting it to "Allow" will allow it. This
   preference is important because it determines whether or not a patron
   can place a request for an item that might be in the process of being
   repaired or not in good condition. The library may wish to set this
   to "Don't allow" if they were concerned about their patrons not
   receiving the item in a timely manner or at all (if it is determined
   that the item is beyond repair). Setting it to "Allow" would allow a
   patron to place a hold on an item and therefore receive it as soon as
   it becomes available.

.. _allowholdsonpatronspossessions-label:

AllowHoldsOnPatronsPossessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_\_ a patron to place a hold on a record where the patron
already has one or more items attached to that record checked out.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  By setting to "Don't allow," you can prevent patrons from placing
   holds on items they already have out, thus preventing them from
   blocking anyone else from getting an item.

.. _allowrenewalifotheritemsavailable-label:

AllowRenewalIfOtherItemsAvailable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a patron to renew an item with unfilled holds if other
available items can fill that hold.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _autoresumesuspendedholds-label:

AutoResumeSuspendedHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ suspended holds to be automatically resumed by a set date.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If this preference is set to 'Allow' then all suspended holds will be
   able to have a date at after which they automatically become
   unsuspended. If you have this preference set to 'Allow' you will also
   need the :ref:`Unsuspend Holds` cron job running.

    **Important**

    The holds will become unsuspended the date after that entered by the
    patron.

.. _canmarkholdstopullaslost-label:

CanMarkHoldsToPullAsLost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do not allow to mark items as lost

Asks: \_\_\_ from the 'Holds to pull' screen

Values:

-  Allow to mark items as lost

-  Allow to mark items as lost and notify the patron

-  Do not allow to mark items as lot

Description:

-  This preference lets you choose whether the staff can mark items
   as lost directly from the 'Holds to pull' list if they can't
   find the item on the shelf.

.. _canreservefromotherbranches-label:

canreservefromotherbranches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a user from one library to place a hold on an item from
another library

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether patrons
   can place holds on items from other branches. If the preference is
   set to "Allow" patrons can place such holds, if it is set to "Don't
   allow" they cannot. This is an important setting because it
   determines if users can use Koha to request items from another
   branch. If the library is sharing an installation of Koha with other
   independent libraries which do not wish to allow interlibrary
   borrowing it is recommended that this parameter be set to "Don't
   allow".

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow (with :ref:`IndependentBranches`)

.. _confirmfutureholds-label:

ConfirmFutureHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 0

Asks: Confirm future hold requests (starting no later than \_\_\_ days
from now) at checkin time.

Description:

-  When confirming a hold at checkin time, the number of days in this
   preference is taken into account when deciding which holds to show
   alerts for. This preference does not interfere with renewing,
   checking out or transferring a book.

    **Note**

    This number of days will be used too in calculating the default end
    date for the Holds to pull-report. But it does not interfere with
    issuing, renewing or transferring books.

    **Important**

    This preference is only looked at if you're allowing hold dates in
    the future with :ref:`AllowHoldDateInFuture`
    or :ref:`OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture`

.. _decreaseloanhighholds-preferences-label:

decreaseLoanHighHolds, decreaseLoanHighHoldsDuration, decreaseLoanHighHoldsValue, decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl, and decreaseLoanHighHoldsIgnoreStatuses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ the reduction of loan period \_\_\_ to days for items with
more than \_\_\_ holds \_\_\_ . Ignore items with the following statuses
when counting items \_\_\_

decreaseLoanHighHolds default: Don't enable

decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl default: on the record

decreaseLoanHighHolds values:

-  Enable

decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl values:

-  over the number of holdable items on the records

-  on the record

decreaseLoanHighHoldsIgnoreStatuses values:

-  [Select All]

-  Damages

-  Lost

-  Not for loan

-  Withdrawn

Description:

-  These preferences let you change the loan length for items that have
   many holds on them. This will not effect items that are already
   checked out, but items that are checked out after the
   decreaseLoanHighHoldsValue is met will only be checked out for the
   number of days entered in the decreaseLoanHighHoldsDuration
   preference.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ the ability to place holds on multiple biblio from the
search results

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

.. _emaillibrarianwhenholdisplaced-label:

emailLibrarianWhenHoldIsPlaced
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ sending an email to the Koha administrator email address
whenever a hold request is placed.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  This preference enables Koha to email the library staff whenever a
   patron requests an item to be held. While this function will
   immediately alert the librarian to the patron's need, it is extremely
   impractical in most library settings. In most libraries the hold
   lists are monitored and maintained from a separate interface. That
   said, many libraries that allow on shelf holds prefer to have this
   preference turned on so that they are alerted to pull an item from
   the shelf.

    **Important**

    In order for this email to send you must have a
    :ref:`notice <notices-and-slips-label>` template with the code of HOLDPLACED

    **Important**

    This notice will only be sent if the :ref:`process\_message\_queue.pl
    cron job <cron-message-queue-label>` is being run periodically to send the
    messages.

.. _excludeholidaysfrommaxpickupdelay-label:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to expire automatically if they have not been picked
by within the time period specified in
:ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay`

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If set to 'allow' this will cancel holds that have been waiting for
   longer than the number of days specified in the
   :ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay` system
   preference. Holds will only be cancelled if the :ref:`Expire Holds cron
   job <cron-expired-holds-label>` is runnning.

.. _expirereservesmaxpickupdelaycharge-label:

ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelayCharge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 0

Asks: If using
:ref:`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay`, charge
a borrower who allows his or her waiting hold to expire a fee of \_\_\_
USD

Description:

-  If you are expiring holds that have been waiting too long you can use
   this preference to charge the patron for not picking up their hold.
   If you don't charge patrons for items that aren't picked up you can
   leave this set to the default which is 0. Holds will only be
   cancelled and charged if the :ref:`Expire Holds cron
   job <cron-expired-holds-label>` is running.

.. _expirereservesonholidays-label:

ExpireReservesOnHolidays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ expired holds to be cancelled on days the library is
closed.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _holdssplitqueue-label:

Default: nothing

Asks: In the staff client, split the holds queue into separate tables by \_\_\_

Values:

-  pickup library

-  pickup library and itemtype

-  hold itemtype

-  nothing

Description:

-  This feature allows you to separate holds by pickup library or itemtype in the
   holds page of a record (not in the global holds queue found on the circulation
   page).

-  When using the up and down arrows the priorities will be changed only
   in the group the holds belongs to.

.. _holdssplitqueuenumbering-label:

HoldsSplitQueueNumbering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: the actual priority, which may be out of order

Asks: If the holds queue is split, show librarians \_\_\_

Values:

-  the actual priority, which may be out of order

-  'virtual' priorities, where each group is numbered separately

Description:

-  This system preference is only effective if :ref:`HoldsSplitQueue` is set to
   any value except 'nothing'.

-  This system preference controls the priority numbering on the holds page
   of a record (not in the global holds queue found on the circulation page).

.. _localholdspriority-preferences-label:

LocalHoldsPriority, LocalHoldsPriorityPatronControl, LocalHoldsPriorityItemControl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ priority for filling holds to patrons whose \_\_\_ matches
the item's \_\_\_

LocalHoldsPriority Values:

-  Don't give

-  Give

LocalHoldsPriorityPatronControl Values:

      enabled for this to work

-  Don't allow

.. _opacallowusertochoosebranch-label:

OPACAllowUserToChooseBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a user to choose the library to pick up a hold from.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  Changing this preference will not prevent staff from being able to
   transfer titles from one library to another to fill a hold, it will
   only prevent patrons from saying they plan on picking a book up at a
   library other than their home library.

-  The list of available pickup locations will include all libraries that
   have 'Pickup location' set to 'Yes' on the library configuration page.

.. _opacholdsifavailableatpickup-label:

OPACHoldsIfAvailableAtPickup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ to pickup holds at libraries where the item is available.

Values:

-  Don't allow

-  Allow

.. _reservesmaxpickupdelay-label:

ReservesMaxPickUpDelay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 7

Asks: Mark a hold as problematic if it has been waiting for more than
\_\_\_ days.

Description:

-  This preference (based on calendar days, not the
   :ref:`Koha holiday calendar <calendar-label>`) puts an expiration date on an item a
   patron has on hold. After this expiration date the staff will have
   the option to release the unclaimed hold which then may be returned
   to the library shelf or issued to the next patron on the item's hold
   list. Items that are 'expired' by this preference are moved to the
   'Holds Over' tab on the :ref:`Holds Awaiting Pickup <holds-awaiting-pickup-label>`
   report.

.. _reservesneedreturns-label:

ReservesNeedReturns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't automatically

Asks: \_\_\_ mark holds as found and waiting when a hold is placed
specifically on them and they are already checked in.

Values:

-  Automatically

-  Don't automatically

Description:

-  This preference refers to 'item specific' holds where the item is
   currently on the library shelf. This preference allows a library to
   decide whether an 'item specific' hold is marked as "Waiting" at the
   time the hold is placed or if the item will be marked as "Waiting"
   after the item is checked in. This preference will tell the patron
   that their item is 'Waiting' for them at their library and ready for
   check out.

.. _holds-queue-system-preferences-label:

StaticHoldsQueueWeight, HoldsQueueSkipClosed and RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

StaticHoldsQueueWeight Default: 0

HoldsQueueSkipClosed Default: open or closed

RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight Default: in that order

Asks: Satisfy holds using items from the libraries \_\_\_ (as
branchcodes, separated by commas; if empty, uses all libraries) when
they are \_\_\_ \_\_\_.

HoldsQueueSkipClosed Values:

-  open or closed

-  open

RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight Values:

-  in random order

   -  If StaticHoldsQueueWeight is left at the default Koha will
      randomize all libraries, otherwise it will randomize the libraries
      listed.

-  in that order

   -  If StaticHoldsQueueWeight is left at the default then this will
      use all of your branches in alphabetical order, otherwise it will
      use the branches in the order that you entered them in the
      StaticHoldsQueueWeight preference.

Descriptions:

-  These preferences control how the :ref:`Holds Queue
   report <holds-queue-label>` is generated using :ref:`a cron
   job <cron-holds-queue-report-label>`.

   If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the
   on-shelf holds fulfillment process, you should list the the libraries
   that \*do\* participate in the process here by inputting all the
   participating library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g.
   "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc. ).

   By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system
   will first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the
   pickup library if possible. If there are no items available at the
   pickup library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use
   the list of libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled ( which it is by default ), the
   script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
   placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

   For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
   small, medium and large ) and you want the burden of holds
   fulfillment to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you
   would want StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like
   "LRG,MED,SML".

   If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
   throughout your library system, simply enable
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight. When this system preference is enabled,
   the order in which libraries will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf
   hold will be randomized each time the list is regenerated.

    **Important**

    The :ref:`Transport Cost Matrix <transport-cost-matrix-label>` takes
    precedence in controlling where holds are filled from, if the matrix
    is not used then Koha checks the StaticHoldsQueueWeight. To use the
    Transport Cost Matrix simply set your
    :ref:`UseTransportCostMatrix` preference to
    'Use'

.. _suspendholdsintranet-label:

SuspendHoldsIntranet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to be suspended from the intranet.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  The holds suspension feature can be turned on and off in the staff
   client by altering this system preference. If this is set to 'allow'
   you will want to set the
   :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds` system
   preference.

Description:

-  The holds suspension feature can be turned on and off in the OPAC by
   altering this system preference. If this is set to 'allow' you will
   want to set the
   :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds` system
   preference.

.. _transferwhencancelallwaitingholds-label:

TransferWhenCancelAllWaitingHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't transfer

Asks: \_\_\_ items when cancelling all waiting holds.

Values:

-  Don't transfer

-  Transfer

Description:

-  When TransferWhenCancelAllWaitingHolds is set to "Don't transfer", no
   branch transfer records are created. Koha will not allow the holds to
   be transferred, because that would orphan the items at the library
   where the holds were awaiting pickup, without any further instruction
   to staff as to what items are at the library or where they need to
   go. When that system preference set to "Transfer", branch transfers
   are created, so the holds may be cancelled.

.. _updateitemwhenlostfromholdlist-label:

UpdateItemWhenLostFromHoldList
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Update item's values when marked as lost from the hold to pull screen.

Description:

-  This is a list of values to update an item when it is marked as lost from
   the holds to pull screen. For example, write "itemlost: 1" to set the items.
   itemlost value to 1 when the item is marked as lost. This will use the authorized
   value 1 from the LOST authorized value list.

This preference if set to allow will give your patrons the option to add
a note to an item they have checked out on the OPAC side.  This note will be
seen on the staff side when the item is checked in.

.. _allowofflinecirculation-label:

AllowOfflineCirculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do not enable

Asks: \_\_\_ offline circulation on regular circulation computers.

Values:

-  Do not enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  Setting this preference to 'Enable' allows you to use the Koha
   interface for :ref:`offline circulation <offline-circulation-utilities-label>`. This system
   preference does not affect the :ref:`Firefox
   plugin <firefox-plugin-label>` or the :ref:`desktop
   application <offline-circ-tool-for-windows-label>`, any of these three options can
   be used for offline circulation without effecting the other.

.. _autoswitchpatron-label:

AutoSwitchPatron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ the automatic redirection to another patron when a patron
barcode is scanned instead of a book. This should not be enabled if you
have overlapping patron and book barcodes.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  Enabling this system preference allows staff to scan a patron barcode instead
   of an item barcode in the checkout box to switch patron records.

.. _circautocompl-label:

CircAutocompl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Try

Asks: \_\_\_ to automatically fill in the member when entering a patron
search on the circulation screen.

   (:ref:`ISSUEQSLIP <existing-notices-and-slips-label>`) or open a slip

   preference is set to clear the screen then "checking out" an empty
   barcode will clear the screen of the patron you were last working

FilterBeforeOverdueReport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't require

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to choose which checkouts to show before running the
overdues report.

Description:

-  Koha's overdue report shows you all of the overdue items in your
   library system. If you have a large library system you'll want to set
   this preference to 'Require' to force those running the report to
   first limit the data generated to a branch, date range, patron
   category or other such filter. Requiring that the report be filtered
   before it's run prevents your staff from running a system heavy
   report and slowing down other operations in the system.

during an item barcode search.

Values:

Description:

-  Sometimes libraries want to checkout using something other than the
   barcode. Enabling this preference will do a keyword search of Koha to
   find the item you're trying to check out. You can use the call
   number, barcode, part of the title or anything you'd enter in the
   keyword search when this preference is enabled and Koha will ask you
   which item you're trying to check out.

staff can override that if you allow them to specify a due date at

   from the automatic due date to another calendar date. This option
   would be used for circumstances in which the due date may need to be
   decreased or extended in a specific circumstance. The "Allow" setting
   would allow for this option to be utilized by staff, the "Don't

-  Do not

Description:

-  Koha can track the number of times and item is checked out and store
   that on the item record in the database. This information is not
   stored by default. Setting this preference to 'Do' will tell Koha to
   track that info everytime the item is checked out in real time.
   Otherwise you could use the :ref:`cron job <cron-track-total-checkouts-label>` to have
   Koha update that field nightly.

   for the title in question.. According to *Libraries Unlimited's

Coce Cover images cache

Values:

Description:

-  Coce has many benefits when it comes to choosing and displaying cover
   images in Koha:

   -  If a book cover is not available from a provider, but is available
      from another one, Koha will be able to display a book cover, which
      isn't the case now

   -  Since URLs are cached, it isn't necessary for each book cover to
      request, again and again, the provider, and several of them if
      necessary.

   -  Amazon book covers are retrieved with Amazon Product Advertising
      API, which means that more covers are retrieved (ISBN13).

       **Important**

       Coce does not come bundled with Koha. Your Koha install will not
       already have a Coce server set up. Before enabling this
       functionality you will want to be sure to have a Coce server set

   can specify it by entering opac-mystyles.css in your
   opaccolorstylesheet system preference. This adds your custom
   stylesheet as a linked stylesheet alongside the OPAC's default CSS
   files. This method is preferable because linked stylesheets are
   cached by the user's browser, meaning upon repeat visits to your site
   the user's browser will not have to re-download the stylesheet,
   instead using the copy in the browser's cache.

.. _patronselfregistrationdefaultcategory-label:

PatronSelfRegistrationDefaultCategory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use the patron category code \_\_\_ as the default patron category
for patrons registered via the OPAC.

Description:

-  Enter in the patron category code for the category that all new
   patrons registered via the OPAC will be put in to.

    **Important**

    Patrons registering via the OPAC will not need to be approved by a
    librarian. For this reason it is recommended that you set up a
    provisional :ref:`patron category <patron-categories-label>` with no :ref:`circulation
    rights <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`. That way patrons will have to come in to
    the library to verify their identity before given circulation rights
    at the library. Once the patron confirms their identiy the library
    staff can change the category to one with permissions to check items
    out and place holds.

    **Important**

    If you leave this blank or enter in an invalid code your patrons
    will still be able to register but will not be given a username.
    There will be no errors on the page to explain this, so be sure to
    enter a valid patron category code.

\_\_\_ days.

Description:

-  This preference links to the :ref:`delete\_expired\_opac\_registrations.pl
   cron job <cron-unverified-registrations-label>`. If that cron is set to
   run nightly it will clean up any registrations that have not been
   verified via email in the number of days entered on this preference.
   This is dependent on
   :ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail`
   preference.

.. _patronselfregistrationlibrarylist-label:

Values:

-  Don't require

   not be able to log in to the OPAC until they acknowledge the email
   sent by Koha. If you don't require this then patrons will be able to
   log in as soon as they fill in the registration form. You can set the
   :ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationExpireTemporaryAccountsDelay`
   preference to delete the un-verified self registrations after a

   via the OPAC and lets patrons see other books that may relate to
   their search and items that sit on the shelf near the item they are
   looking at.

    **Important**

    This uses up a fairly large amount of resources on your server, and
    should be avoided if your collection has a large number of items.

Default: Do

Asks: \_\_\_ default the card number field on the patron addition screen
to the next available card number

Values:

-  Do

   -  If the largest currently used card number is 26345000012941, then
      this field will default to 26345000012942 for the next patron

-  Don't

Description:

-  This preference determines if the patron's barcode is automatically
   calculated. This prevents the person setting up the library card
   account from having to assign a number to the new card. If set to

   the maximum barcode already present in the database.

.. _borrowermandatoryfield-label:

    **Note**

    For help with field names, ask your system administrator or `view
    the database

    in the "Patrons" toolbar.

.. _borrowerrelationship-label:

borrowerRelationship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: father\|mother

Asks: Guarantors can be the following of those they guarantee \_\_\_

Description:

-  This preference enables the system administrator to define valid
   relationships between a guarantor (usually a parent) and a guarantee
   (usually a child). Defining values for this field does not make the
   guarantor field required when adding a guarantee type patron. This
   preference creates a drop down list identifying the relationship of
   the guarantor to the guarantee. To disable the ability to add
   children types in Koha you can leave this field blank.

   fields your library doesn't need to see on the patron entry form.
   Enter field names separated by \| (bar).

    **Important**

    Separate columns with \|

    **Note**

    For help with field names, ask your system administrator or `view
    the database

   this item out. Staff will be prompted to allow the checkout to occur.

   |image1390|

-  If the value is set to 'do not', Koha will not check the patron's circulation
   history.

-  When the value is set to 'Unless overridden, do', this will check the
   patron's circulation history unless the patron's
   :ref:`personal setting <add-a-new-patron-label>` or the :ref:`patron category setting <adding-a-patron-category-label>` specifically say not to.

-  Lastly, if the value is set to 'Unless overridden, do not',
   Koha will not check circulation history unless the patron's :ref:`personal
   setting <add-a-new-patron-label>` or the

searches.

Values:

-  Don't include

-  Include

Description:

-  When this preference is set to include the search engine indexer will
   insert *see from* headings from authority records into bibliographic
   records when indexing, so that a search on an obsolete term will turn
   up relevant records. For example when you search for cookery (the old
   term) you get titles with the heading of cooking (the new term).

    **Important**

    You will need to reindex your bibliographic database when changing
    this preference.

.. _opacgroupresults-label:

   invention, inventory, etc. If you don't want this to happen
   automatically you can still be perform wildcard searches manually by
   adding an asterisk (\*). Typing "invent\*" even with auto truncation
   disabled will retrieve the same inventor, invention, inventory
   results. Auto truncation bypasses the necessity to type long search
   strings in their entirety.

-  Force

   -  Searches for complete subject fields (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=su,complete-subfield:World%20Wide%20Web)

Description:

-  When TraceCompleteSubfields is set to "force," clicking on links in
   non-authority controlled subject tracings will only find other
   records where the entire subfields match. Leaving it at "don't force"
   does a keyword search of the subject indexes.

      opac-search.pl?q=(su,complete-subfield:%22Web%20sites%22)%20and%20(su,complete-subfield:%22Design.%22))

Description:

-  When TraceSubjectSubdivisions is set to "Include," if you click on a
   subject with subdivisions (subfields other than 'a') they will be
   searched along with the subject heading (subfield 'a'). To have only

   :ref:`QueryFuzzy`.

    **Important**

    This setting will not affect Zebra indexing, it should only be used
    to tell Koha that you have activated ICU indexing if you have
    actually done so, since there is no way for Koha to figure this out
    on its own.

.. _oai-pmh-system-preferences-label:

OAI-PMH

.. _oai-pmh-pref-label:

OAI-PMH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Disable

Asks: \_\_\_ Koha's OAI-PMH server.

Values:

-  Disable

-  Enable

Description:

-  Once enabled you can visit http://YOURKOHACATALOG/cgi-bin/koha/oai.pl
   to see your file. For the Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for
   Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) there are two groups of 'participants':
   Data Providers and Service Providers. Data Providers (open archives,
   repositories) provide free access to metadata, and may, but do not
   necessarily, offer free access to full texts or other resources.
   OAI-PMH provides an easy to implement, low barrier solution for Data
   Providers. Service Providers use the OAI interfaces of the Data
   Providers to harvest and store metadata. Note that this means that
   there are no live search requests to the Data Providers; rather,
   services are based on the harvested data via OAI-PMH. Koha at present
   can only act as a Data Provider. It can not harvest from other
   repositories. The biggest stumbling block to having Koha harvest from
   other repositories is that MARC is the only metadata format that Koha
   indexes natively. Visit
   http://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/english/page3.htm for diagrams of how
   OAI-PMH works.
