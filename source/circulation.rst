Circulation
===========

Circulation functions can be accessed in several different ways. On the
main page of the staff client there are some quick links in the center
of the page to check items out, in or transfer them. For a complete
listing of Circulation functions you can visit the Circulation page
which is linked from the top left of every page or from the center of
the main page.

Before circulating your collection you will want to set your :ref:`Global
System Preferences <global-system-preferences-label>`, :ref:`Basic
Parameters <basic-parameters-label>` and :ref:`Patrons & Circulation
Rules <patrons-&-circulation-label>`.

While in Circulation you can jump between the tabs on the quick search
box at the top of the screen by using the following hot keys:

-  jump to the catalog search with Alt+Q

-  jump to the checkout with Alt+U

   -  this will not work for Mac users

-  jump to the checkin with Alt+R

    **Note**

    Mac users use the OPTION button in place of ALT

.. _check-out-(issuing)-label:

Check out (issuing)
--------------------------------------

To begin the checkout process you must enter the patron barcode or part
of their name. The checkout option appears in three main places:

-  Check out option on the top of the main staff client

   |image482|

-  Check out option on the patron record

   |image483|

-  If you have enabled :ref:`batch checkouts <batch-checkout-label>` then
   click the batch check out option on the patron record

   |image1254|

-  Check out option on the quick search bar on the circulation page

   |image484|

.. _checking-items-out-label:

Checking items out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check an item out to a patron, first search for that patron using one
of the many options listed above. You will then be presented with the
checkout screen.

|image485|

If you have chosen to 'Always show checkouts immediately' then you will
see the list of checkouts below the check out box.

|image486|

At the top of the Check out screen is a box for you to type or scan the
item's barcode into.

-  **Important**

       Many modern barcode scanners will send a 'return' to the browser,
       making it so that the 'Check out' button is automatically clicked

-  If the barcode is not found you will be prompted to use fast
   cataloging to add the item. Learn more about :ref:`fast
   cataloging <fast-add-cataloging-label>` later in this manual.

-  If you have
   :ref:`itemBarcodeFallbackSearch` set to
   'Enable' then you can enter a keyword search in this box instead of
   just a barcode (this will make it possible to check out using title
   and/or call number).

-  If you have :ref:`AutoSwitchPatron <autoswitchpatron-label>` set to 'Enable',
   scanning a patron barcode here will take you to that patron's file.

To see more checkout options click the 'Checkout settings' link to
expand the checkout area.

|image1255|

Below the box for the barcode there may be options for you to override
the default due date for the item.

-  This option will only appear if you have set the
   :ref:`SpecifyDueDate` system preference to allow staff
   to override the due date

Below the box for the barcode you will see a checkbox for 'Automatic
renewal'. This will allow this item to automatically renew if the
:ref:`appropriate cron job <automatic-renewal-label>` is running and there are no
holds on the item.

Next is an option to no decrease the loan length based on holds. This
overrides the :ref:`decreaseLoanHighHolds <decreaseloanhighholds,-decreaseloanhighholdsduration,-decreaseloanhighholdsvalue,-decreaseloanhighholdscontrol,-and-decreaseloanhighholdsignorestatuses-label>`
preference.

If you're allowing the :ref:`checkout of items on site <onsitecheckouts-label>`
to patrons (these are usually items that are not for loan that you would
like to check for in library use) then you will see the 'On-site
checkout' checkbox after clicking the 'Checkout settings' link to expand
your circulation options.

|image1256|

At the bottom of the page there is a summary of the patron's current
checked out items along with the due date (and time if the item is an
hourly loan), items checked out today will appear at the top.

    **Note**

    Items that are hourly loan items will include the time with the due
    date.

|image487|

If you checked out an item for on site use you will see that highlighted
in red in the checkout summary.

|image488|

If you have set your `ExportWithCsvProfile <#ExportWithCsvProfile>`__
preference, you will also see the option to export the patron's current
checkout information using a CSV profile or ISO2709 (MARC21) format.

|image489|

Also at the bottom of the page is the list of items the patron has on
hold

|image490|

From the holds list you can suspend or resume patrons holds using the
options at the bottom of the list if you have the
:ref:`SuspendHoldsIntranet` preference set to
'allow.'

    **Note**

    If you have your
    :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds` preference
    set to "Don't allow" then you will not have the option to put an end
    date on the hold suspension

If there are notes on the patron record these will appear to the right
of the checkout box

|image491|

If the patron has a hold waiting at the library that too will appear to
the right of the check out box making it easy for the circulation
librarian to see that there is another item to give the patron

|image492|

The details of the checkouts will appear on the bib detail page in the
staff client as well.

|image493|

.. _printing-receipts-label:

Printing receipts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have checked out all of the items for the patron you can print
them a receipt by choosing one of two methods.

If you have the :ref:`CircAutoPrintQuickSlip`
preference set to 'open a print quick slip window' you can simply hit
enter on your keyboard or scan a blank piece of paper with your barcode
scanner. The idea being that you're "checking out" a blank barcode which
triggers Koha to print the 'Quick slip.'

You can also click the Print button at the top of the screen and choose
'Print slip' or 'Print quick slip'.

|image494|

If you choose 'Print slip' it will print all of the items the patron has
checked out, including those they checked out at an earlier date.
Choosing 'Print quick slip' will print only the items that were checked
out today.

'Print summary' will generate a full page summary for the patron's
circulation information and 'Print overdues' will print out a slip that
lists all items that are overdue.

What prints on the slips can be customized by altering the slip
templates under the :ref:`Notices & Slips` tool.

.. _clear-patron-information-label:

Clear patron information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you're done checking an item out if you have the
:ref:`DisplayClearScreenButton` preference set
to 'Show' you can clear the current patron by clicking the X in the top
right of the patron's info to remove the current patron from the screen
and start over.

|image495|

If you have the :ref:`CircAutoPrintQuickSlip`
preference set to 'clear the screen' then you simply need to hit enter
or scan a blank barcode and the screen will be cleared of the current
patron.

.. _batch-checkouts-label:

Batch checkouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to perform a batch check out you can do so by turning
on the :ref:`BatchCheckouts` system preference and
assigning the proper patron categories via the
:ref:`BatchCheckoutsValidCategories`
preference. This will allow you to use an RFID pad that reads multiple
barcodes or perform a batch check out for training internal use.

|image1257|

From this screen you can scan several barcodes or load a file of
barcodes. If those items cannot be checked out they will provide a
warning on the following screen

|image496|

If you are using a statistical patron type then you'll see that local
use was recorded for each item you scanned.

|image497|

.. _check-out-messages-label:

Check out messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you check out an item that has multiple pieces and you have cataloged
that information in subfield 3 of the item record (in MARC21) a message
will pop up when you check out that item telling you how many pieces
should be there.

|image498|

There are times when Koha will prevent the librarian from being able to
check out items to a patron. When this happens a warning will appear
notifying the librarian of why the patron cannot check items out.

-  Patron owes too much in fines

   |image499|

   -  You can set the amount at which patron checkouts are blocked with
      the :ref:`noissuescharge` system preference

-  Patron has a restriction on their account

   |image500|

   -  This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and
      adding a `restriction <#patronflags>`__ or by the :ref:`Overdue/Notice
      Status Triggers <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`

   -  If the staff member has the right permission they can override the
      restriction temporarily

      |image501|

-  Patron needs to confirm their address

   |image502|

   -  This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and
      adding a `flag <#patronflags>`__

-  Patrons has lost their library card

   |image503|

   -  This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and
      adding a `flag <#patronflags>`__

.. _check-out-warnings-label:

Check out warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes checkouts will trigger warning messages that will appear in a
yellow box above the check out field. These warnings need to be
acknowledged before you will be able to continue checking items out.

-  Patron has outstanding fines

   |image504|

-  Item on hold for someone else

   |image505|

-  Item should be on the hold shelf waiting for someone else

   |image506|

-  Item already checked out to this patron

   |image507|

-  Item checked out to another patron

   |image508|

   -  This warning will allow you to place a hold on the item for the
      patron you're trying to check it out to.

-  Item not for loan

   |image509|

-  Patron has too many things checked out and
   :ref:`AllowTooManyOverride` is set to 'Allow'

   |image510|

-  Patron has too many things checked out and
   :ref:`AllowTooManyOverride` is set to "Don't
   allow"

   |image511|

-  Item cannot be renewed

   |image512|

   -  This can be overridden with the
      :ref:`AllowRenewalLimitOverride` system
      preference

-  Barcode not found

   |image513|

   -  Learn more about :ref:`fast cataloging <fast-add-cataloging-label>` later in this
      manual.

-  Item being checked out is marked as 'lost'

   -  Depending on the value in your :ref:`IssueLostItem`
      preference, you may just see a warning

      |image514|

      or a confirmation box

      |image515|

-  Item being checked out is not recommended for a patron of this age

   |image516|

-  Item being checked out meets the
   :ref:`decreaseLoanHighHolds <decreaseloanhighholds,-decreaseloanhighholdsduration,-decreaseloanhighholdsvalue,-decreaseloanhighholdscontrol,-and-decreaseloanhighholdsignorestatuses-label>` system preference
   criteria

   |image517|

.. _renewing-label:

Renewing
-------------------------

Checked out items can be renewed (checked out for another period of
time) based on your :ref:`circulation rules <circulation-and-fine-rules-label>` and :ref:`renewal
preferences <renewalperiodbase-label>`.

If :ref:`you allow it <opacrenewalallowed-label>`, patrons can renew their own
items via the OPAC, but sometimes you'll need to help them by renewing
their items via the staff client.

To renew items checked out to a patron, you can do one of two things.

The first is to visit their details page or checkout page and review
their checkout summary at the bottom.

|image518|

In the Renew column you will see how many times each item has been
renewed and a checkbox to renew the item for the patron. Check the boxed
of the items you would like to renew and click the 'Renew or return
checked items' button, or to renew all items checked out to the patron
simply click the 'Renew all' button.

|image519|

Sometimes renewals will be blocked based on your circulation rules, to
override this block you must have your
:ref:`AllowRenewalLimitOverride` preference
set to 'Allow'. If you allow renewal limit overrides, you will see a
checkbox at the bottom left of the circulation summary. Check that box
and then choose the items you would like to renew.

|image520|

Checking that box will add checkboxes in the renew column above where
before the item was not renewable.

The second option is to visit the 'Renew' page found under the
Circulation menu.

|image521|

And scan the barcodes of the items you would like to renew.

|image522|

If the item is renewed you will receive a confirmation message.

|image523|

If the barcode is not found you will be presented with an error.

|image524|

If the item is not actually checked out you will also receive an error.

|image525|

.. _check-in-(returning)-label:

Check in (returning)
--------------------------------------

Checking in items can be performed from various different locations

-  The check in box on the top of the main staff client

   |image526|

-  The check in option on the quick search bar on the Circulation page

   |image527|

-  The check in link on the patron's checkout summary (and on the
   checkout summary page)

   |image528|

-  The Check in page under the Circulation menu

   |image529|

.. _checking-items-in-label:

Checking items in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check an item in scan the barcode for the item into the box provided.
A summary of all items checked in will appear below the checkin box

|image530|

If you are checking items in that were put in the book drop while the
library was closed you can check the 'Book drop mode' box before
scanning items. This will effectively roll back the returned date to the
last date the library was open.

-  This requires that you have your closings added to the :ref:`Holidays &
   calendar tool <calendar-label>`

You can also choose to forgive all overdue charges for items you are
checking in by checking the 'Forgive overdue charges' box before
scanning items.

If you have the :ref:`SpecifyReturnDate` preference
set to 'Allow' you will be able to arbitrarily set the return date from
below the check in box.

|image1258|

.. _check-in-messages-label:

Check in messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several messages that can appear when checking items in:

-  If you are checking an item in at a library other than the home
   branch, a message will appear asking you to transfer the book to the
   home library

   |image531|

   -  After this item is checked in the status of the item will be
      changed in the catalog to 'in transit'

      |image532|

   -  To mark an item as back at the home branch, check the item in at
      the home branch

      |image533|

      -  A message will appear tell you that the item is not checked
         out, but the status will now say available in the catalog. This
         step is necessary to mark items as received by the home branch.

-  If you are checking in an item that should have multiple parts or
   pieces a message will appear warning you about the number of pieces
   you should have in your hand

   |image534|

-  If you're checking an item in that has a hold on it, you will be
   prompted to confirm the hold

   |image535|

   -  Clicking the Confirm hold button will mark the item as waiting for
      pickup from the library

      |image536|

   -  Clicking the 'Print slip and confirm' button will mark the item as
      waiting for pickup at the library and present the library with a
      receipt to print and place on the book with the patron's
      information

   -  Ignoring the hold will leave the item on hold, but leave its
      status as Available (it will not cancel the hold)

-  If you're checking in an item that has a hold on it at another branch
   you will be prompted to confirm and transfer the item

   |image537|

   -  Clicking the 'Confirm hold and transfer' button will mark the item
      as in transit to the library where the hold was placed

      |image538|

   -  Clicking the 'Print slip, transfer and confirm' button will mark the
      item as in transit to the library where the hold was placed and
      present the library with a receipt to print and place on the book
      with the patron's information

   -  Ignoring the hold will leave the item on hold, but leave its
      status as Available (it will not cancel the hold)

-  If you have the system showing you fines at the time of checkin
   (:ref:`FineNotifyAtCheckin`) you will see a
   message telling you about the fine and providing you a link to the
   payment page for that patron

   |image539|

.. _circulation-messages-label:

Circulation messages
----------------------------------------

Circulation messages are short messages that librarians can leave for
their patrons or their colleagues that will appear at the time of
circulation.

.. _setting-up-messages-label:

Setting up messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Circulation messages are set up as :ref:`authorized
values <authorized-values-label>`. To add or edit circulation messages you
want to work with the `BOR\_NOTES <#bornotes>`__ value.

|image540|

The 'Description' field can hold a canned message that you would like to
appear on the patron's record.

    **Important**

    The 'Description' field is limited to 80 characters, but the patron
    message field can hold more than that. Enter 80 characters in the
    'Description' field and then type the rest on the patron record.

.. _adding-a-message-label:

Adding a message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When on the patron's check out tab you will see a link to 'Add a new
message' to the right of the check out box and a button at the top to
'Add message'.

|image541|

When you click either of these options you will be asked to choose if
the message is for the librarians or the patron and the message you
would like to leave.

|image542|

    **Note**

    A message for the patron will also show to the library staff.

.. _viewing-messages-label:

Viewing messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Circulation messages meant for the staff and/or the patron will appear
on the patron's checkout screen to the right of the checkout box.
Messages in bold and red are meant for the library staff only, whereas
messages in regular italics font are meant for the patron and the
librarian.

|image543|

Circulation messages meant for the patron will also appear when they log
into the OPAC.

|image544|

.. _holds-label:

Holds
------------------

Koha allows patrons to put things on hold. A 'Hold' is a way to reserve
an item. Depending on your :ref:`circulation and fine
rules <circulation-and-fine-rules-label>` and :ref:`hold preference <holds-policy-label>`
settings patrons will be able to place items on hold for pickup at the
library at a later date/time.

.. _placing-holds-in-staff-client-label:

Placing holds in staff client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to place holds from the staff client. The most
obvious is using the 'Place hold' button at the top of any bibliographic
record.

|image545|

You can also click the smaller 'Place hold' link found at the top of
your catalog search results, or the 'Holds' link found below each
result.

|image546|

You will be asked to search for a patron by barcode or any part of their
name to start the hold process.

|image547|

If you'd like to search for the patron first and then the bib record for
the hold, you can open the patron record and click on the 'Search to
Hold' button at the top of the patron record.

|image548|

After clicking the button you will be brought to the catalog search page
where you can find the book(s) you want to place a hold on. Under each
title on the results you'll see an option to 'Hold for Patron Name.'

|image549|

If you want to place a hold on multiple items, simply check the boxes to
the left of them and click the arrow to the right of the 'Place Hold'
button.

|image550|

Depending on how many items you choose to place a hold on at once you
will see a different place hold form. If you are placing a hold on one
bibliographic record you will see a list of all of the items you can
place a hold on.

|image551|

-  Enter any notes that might apply to this hold

-  Choose the library where the patron will pick up the item

-  If you have the
   :ref:`AllowHoldItemTypeSelection`
   preference set to 'Allow' and the record had more than one item type
   attached you will see an option to choose to limit the hold to a
   specific item type

   |image1259|

-  If the patron wants the hold to start on a date other than today,
   enter that in the 'Hold starts on date' field

   -  This option will only appear if the
      :ref:`AllowHoldDateInFuture` system
      preference is set to 'Allow'

-  If the patron has specified that they don't want the item after a
   certain date, or if you have limits on hold lengths, you can enter an
   expiration date for the hold in the 'Hold expires on date'

   -  To have expired holds cancelled automatically you will need to have
      the :ref:`Expired holds` cron job set to run on a
      regular basis.

-  Next choose if you want to place a hold on the next available item or
   a specific item by clicking the radio button next to an individual
   item.

If you're placing a hold on multiple items you will be presented with
the next available option for all titles. If no items are available for
hold it will say so on the confirmation screen.

|image552|

Once your hold is placed, if you'd like to have Koha forget that you
used the 'Search to hold' function, you can choose to have Koha 'forget'
the patron's name by clicking the arrow to the right of the 'Place hold'
button on the search results and choosing the 'Forget' option.

|image553|

.. _managing-holds-label:

Managing holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Holds can be altered and cancelled from the holds tab found on the left
of the bibliographic record.

|image554|

From the list of holds you can change the order of the holds, the pickup
location, suspend and/or cancel the hold.

|image555|

    **Note**

    If you have your
    :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds` preference
    set to "Don't allow" then you will not have the option to put an end
    date on the hold suspension

    **Note**

    Depending on how you have your :ref:`HidePatronName`
    system preference set the list may show card numbers instead of
    names in the patron column like in the image above.

To rearrange or delete holds, simply make a selection from the
'Priority' pull down or click the arrows to the right of the priority
pull down.

|image556|

If you use the priority pull down to rearrange or delete holds you will
need to click the 'Update hold(s)' button to save your changes.

Clicking the down arrow to the right of the hold will stick the hold at
the bottom of the list even if more requests are made.

For example, your library has home-bound patrons that are allowed to
keep books out for months at a time. It would not be fair to other
patrons if a home-bound patron were able to check out a brand new book
and keep it for months. For this reason, the home-bound patron's hold
request would stay at the bottom of the queue until everyone else who
wanted to read that book has already done so.

|image557|

If a patron asks to have their hold suspended and you have the
:ref:`SuspendHoldsIntranet` system preference set
to 'allow' you can do so by clicking the 'Suspend' button to far right. If
the patron gives you a date for the items to become unsuspended you can
enter that in the date box and click the 'Update hold(s)' button to save
your changes.

|image558|

To delete or cancel a hold click the red 'X' to the right of the hold
line. To delete/cancel a bunch of holds you can choose 'del' from pull
down to the left of each line and then click 'Update hold(s)' at the
bottom of the list.

|image559|

.. _receiving-holds-label:

Receiving holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When items that are on hold are :ref:`checked in <check-in-(returning)-label>` or
:ref:`out <check-out-(issuing)-label>` the system will remind the circulation librarian
that the item is on hold and offer them options for managing the hold.

When you check in an item that has a hold on it the system will ask you
to either confirm and transfer the item

|image560|

or just confirm the hold

|image561|

Clicking the 'Confirm' button will mark the item as on hold for the
patron. If the item needs to be transferred the item will also be marked
as in transit to the proper branch. Clicking 'Ignore' will retain the
hold, but allow you to check the item out to another patron. Choosing to
confirm and print will present you with a printable page that you can
slip inside the book with the necessary hold and/or transfer
information.

Once confirmed the hold will show on the patron record and on the
checkout screen under the 'Hold' tab.

|image490|

From here if the patron would like you suspend their holds you can do so
one by one or in bulk.

The item record will also show that the item is on hold.

|image563|

In some cases a patron may come in to pick up a hold for their partner
(or someone else in their household). In this case you want to make sure
that the hold is cancelled when you check the item out to someone else.
When trying to check out an item that is already waiting for someone
else you will be presented with a warning message.

|image564|

From here you can check the item out to the patron at the desk and
cancel the hold for the patron.

.. _transfers-label:

Transfers
--------------------------

If you work in a multi-branch system you can transfer items from one
library to another by using the Transfer tool.

-  *Get there*: Circulation > Transfer

To transfer an item

-  Click 'Transfer' on the Circulation page

   |image565|

   -  Enter the library you would like to transfer the item to

   -  Scan or type the barcode on the item you would like to transfer

-  Click 'Submit'

   |image566|

-  The item will now say that it is in transit

   |image567|

-  When the item arrives at the other branch the librarian must check
   the item in to acknowledge that it is no longer in transit

-  The item will not be permanently moved to the new library

   |image568|

   -  The item shows the same 'Home library' but has updated the
      'Current location' to note where it resides at this time

.. _set-library-label:

Set library
-----------------------------

By default you will enter the staff client as if you are at your home
library. This library will appear in the top right of the staff client.

|image569|

This is the library that all circulation transactions will take place
at. If you are at another library (or on a bookmobile) you will want to
set your library before you start circulating items. To do this you can
click 'Set' at the top right or on the Circulation page.

|image570|

Once you have saved your changes you new library will appear in the top
right.

.. _fast-add-cataloging-label:

Fast add cataloging
-------------------------------------

Sometimes circulation librarians need to quickly add a record to the
system for an item they are about to check out. This is called 'Fast
add'. To allow circulation librarians access to the Fast add cataloging
tool, simply make sure they have the
`fast\_cataloging <#fastaddpermissions>`__ permissions. There are two
ways to add titles via fast add. If you know that you're about to check
out an item that isn't in you catalog you can go to the Circulation
module and click 'Fast cataloging.'

|image571|

The cataloging interface will open up with the short cataloging record:

|image572|

After adding your cataloging data you will be asked to enter item data.
Enter the items barcode, collection code, etc and save the item before
checking it out.

The other way to fast catalog is from the checkout screen. When you
enter a barcode at checkout that Koha can't find, it will prompt you to
use fast cataloging to add the item to Koha and check it out.

|image573|

Clicking 'Fast cataloging' will bring you to the fast cataloging form
where you can enter the title information

|image574|

After clicking 'Save' you will be brought to the item record where the
barcode will already be filled in with the barcode you're trying to
check out.

|image575|

After clicking the 'Add item' button the item will automatically be
checked out the patron you were trying to check the book out to
originally.

|image576|

.. _circulation-reports-label:

Circulation reports
--------------------------------------

Most reports can be found via the Reports module, but some of the more
common circulation reports are available right from the Circulation
module.

-  *Get there*: Circulation > Circulation reports

.. _holds-queue-label:

Holds queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you all of the holds at your library.

|image577|

To generate this report, you must have the :ref:`Build holds queue cron
job <holds-queue-label>` running. This cron job is a script that should
be run periodically if your library system allows borrowers to place
on-shelf holds. This script decides which library should be responsible
for fulfilling a given hold request.

It's behavior is controlled by the system preferences
:ref:`StaticHoldsQueueWeight <staticholdsqueueweight,-holdsqueueskipclosed-&-randomizeholdsqueueweight-label>` and
:ref:`RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight <staticholdsqueueweight,-holdsqueueskipclosed-&-randomizeholdsqueueweight-label>`.

If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the on-shelf
holds fulfillment process, you should list the libraries that \*do\*
participate in the process here by inputting all the participating
library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g. "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc.
).

By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system will
first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the pickup
library if possible. If there are no items available at the pickup
library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use the list of
libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled (which it is by default), the
script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
small, medium and large) and you want the burden of holds fulfillment
to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you would want
StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like "LRG,MED,SML".

If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
throughout your library system, simply enable RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight.
When this system preference is enabled, the order in which libraries
will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf hold will be randomized each
time the list is regenerated.

Leaving StaticHoldsQueueWeight empty is contraindicated at this time.
Doing so will cause the build\_holds\_queue script to ignore
RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight, causing the script to request hold
fulfillment not randomly, but by alphabetical order.

.. _holds-to-pull-label:

Holds to pull
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you all of the items that have holds on them that
are available at the library for pulling. If the items are available at
multiple branches then all branches with that item available will see
the hold to pull until one library triggers the hold.

If enabled, clicking the *Mark item as lost* button will mark item as lost and notify
the requesting patron depending on the value of the :ref:`CanMarkHoldsAwaitingPickupAsLost`
system preference.

|image578|

You can limit the results you see by using the Refine box on the left
side of the page:

|image579|

.. _holds-awaiting-pickup-label:

Holds awaiting pickup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show all of the holds that are waiting for patrons to
pick them up.

|image580|

Items that have been on the hold shelf longer than you normally allow
(based on the :ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay`
preference value) will appear on the 'Holds over' tab, they will not
automatically be cancelled unless you have set the :ref:`cron
job <expired-holds-label>` to do that for you, but you can cancel all
holds using the button at the top of the list.

|image581|

.. _hold-ratios-label:

Hold ratios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hold ratios help with collection development. Using this report you will
be able to see how many of your patrons have holds on items and whether
you should buy more. By default it will be set to the library needing 3
items per hold that has been placed. The report will tell you how many
additional items need to be purchased to meet this quota.

|image582|

.. _transfers-to-receive-label:

Transfers to receive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will list all of the items that Koha thinks are in transit
to your library.

|image583|

If your transfers are late in arriving at your library you will see a
message stating how late your items are.

|image584|

    **Important**

    An item is considered late based on the number of days you have
    entered in the
    :ref:`TransfersMaxDaysWarning` system
    preference.
    
.. _article-requests-label:

Article requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First enable your system preference for :ref:`ArticleRequests`. 

Set to 'Enable' patrons to place article requests.

Next you will need to decide how your patrons will make requests, 
either record only, item only, or both record and item level.

You can set 3 different system preferences for mandatory fields to be filled 
in dependent on how your records are requested.

:ref:`ArticleRequestsMandatoryFields`: make the following fields
mandatory for records that are record level or item level requestable

:ref:`ArticleRequestsMandatoryFieldsItemOnly` make the following
fields mandatory for records that are only item level requestable

:ref:`ArticleRequestsMandatoryFieldsRecordOnly` make the
following fields mandatory for records that are only record level
requestable

Next you will want to go into your circulation and fine rules matrix and select 
each rule that you want to allow requests.

You can allow requests to be made at the record level, item level, 
yes (which means both) and no (none).

Now you can place requests on both the staff client and OPAC.

Once the article request has been placed, staff will see new requests at the 
bottom of the home page on the staff client. (In the same location as tags, 
comments and modifications).

From there staff will be able to select requests to process.

The first step would be for a staff member to process the request, that moves 
the request to the processing tab and alerts other staff members that the 
request is in process. On the actions column, click on the dropdown menu and 
select process request. This will move the request to the processing tab.

Next staff will go to the shelf and make a copy of the requested article.

Once that is complete, staff can print the Article request slip (this can be 
customized in notices and slips) and staple or paper clip it to the article. 
In the actions column, you can select the dropdown and select print slip.

Finally, staff will select the complete article request from the actions 
dropdown menu which will send a notice to the patron who made the request 
letting them know the request is ready for pickup.

This removes the article request from the processing tab.

.. _overdues-label:

Overdues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Important**

    For libraries with a large patron base, this report may take a
    significant amount of time to run.

    **Note**

    Large libraries can choose to filter the report before it runs by
    setting the
    :ref:`FilterBeforeOverdueReport` system
    preference to 'Require'.

This report will list all items that are overdue at your library.

|image585|

The report can be filtered using the menu options found on the left of
the report.

    **Note**

    The 'Show any items currently checked out' checkbox basically
    switches this from a report of overdues to a report of checkouts. It
    will show all titles checked out regardless of due date.

.. _overdues-with-fines-label:

Overdues with fines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you any overdues at your library that have accrued
fines on them.

|image586|

If you would like to limit the report you can use the pull down menu at
the top to limit to a specific shelving location at your branch. To see
overdues with fines at other branches you will have to :ref:`change your
branch <set-library-label>` or log in at that branch.

    **Important**

    If you do not charge fines and/or don't have the :ref:`fines cron
    job <fines-label>` running you will see no data on this report.

.. _pending-on-site-checkouts-label:

Pending on-site checkouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the on site checkouts functionality
(:ref:`OnSiteCheckouts`) then you'll have a report to
view all items that are currently checked out on site.

|image1260|

This will list the due date (overdues in red), who has the item, item
information and what library the item is at.

.. _tracking-in-house-use-label:

Tracking in-house use
-----------------------------------------

Many libraries track the use of items within the library.

    **Note**

    This is different from tracking on-site usage. In-house use is the
    use of items in the library by patrons without them having to check
    them out. On-site use is the use of items on site that must first be
    checked out. To learn more about on site usage please review the
    :ref:`OnSiteCheckouts` preference.

Tracking the use of items in the library without checking them out can
be done in Koha one of two ways. The first is to create one or more
:ref:`Statistical Patrons <add-a-statistical-patron-label>`. When collecting items that
have been used within the library, you will want to check them out to
your statistical patron:

|image587|

Instead of marking the item as 'checked out' the system will record that
the item was used in house:

|image588|

Repeat these steps for all items that have been used within the library
to keep accurate statistics for item use.

The other way to record local use of items is to set your
:ref:`RecordLocalUseOnReturn` preference to
'Record.' Then whenever you check an item in that is not checked out and
not on hold a local use will be recorded.

|image589|

    **Note**

    If you have :ref:`RecordLocalUseOnReturn` set
    to 'Record' you can still use your statistical patrons to record
    local use as well.

.. _in-processing-/-book-cart-locations-label:

In processing / book cart locations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Koha allows for handling temporary locations like the processing center
and/or book carts throughout the library. For this feature to work you
must first make sure you have :ref:`authorized values <authorized-values-label>`
set in the `LOC <#shelvelocvals>`__ category for PROC (processing
center) and CART (book cart).

|image590|

Next you need to set the
:ref:`NewItemsDefaultLocation` system preference
to PROC. This will set the new items to the processing center as their
default location.

When creating items you enter in their desired final shelving location
and Koha will temporarily change that to PROC. If
:ref:`InProcessingToShelvingCart` is set to
"Don't move" then when an item with a location of PROC is checked in it
will either automatically update the item to use the permanent location.
If :ref:`InProcessingToShelvingCart` is set
to "Move" then when an item is checked in the location is changed from
PROC to CART.

A :ref:`cron job <in-processing/book-cart-label>` is then set to run at specified intervals
to age items from CART to the permanent shelving location. (For example,
an hourly cron entry of cart\_to\_shelf.pl --hours 3 where --hours is
the amount of time an item should spend on the cart before aging to its
permanent location.)

-  **Note**

       If the :ref:`ReturnToShelvingCart` system
       preference is set to "Move", any newly checked-in item is also
       automatically put into the shelving cart, to be covered by the
       same script run.

-  **Important**

       Checkins with confirmed holds will not go into the shelving cart.
       If items on the shelving cart are checked out, the cart location
       will be cleared.

.. _self-checkout-label:

Self checkout
---------------------------------

Koha comes with a very basic self checkout module. To enable this module
you need to set the :ref:`WebBasedSelfCheck <webbasedselfcheck-label>` system
preference to 'Enable.' To use this module you have to log in as a
:ref:`staff member <add-a-staff-patron-label>` with :ref:`self\_check 
permissions <patron-permissions-label>`.

    **Note**

    Create a :ref:`staff patron <add-a-staff-patron-label>` specifically for this
    action so that you don't leave a real staff client logged into a
    computer all day

There is no link to the Self checkout module, but a simple addition to
the :ref:`OPACUserJS` system preference can add one.

::

    $(document).ready(function(){ 
        $("#login .btn").parent().after("<p><a href=\"http://YOUR_KOHA_OPAC_URL/cgi-bin/koha/sco/sco-main.pl\" target=\"_blank\">Self-Checkout</a></p>");
    });

    **Important**

    The code above has line breaks added to make it more readable,
    please be sure to enter the above as one line in when putting it in
    the system preference.

The link will then appear at the bottom of the log in page:

|image591|

You can also access this module by going to:
http://YOUR\_KOHA\_OPAC\_URL/cgi-bin/koha/sco/sco-main.pl

When on the self checkout page depending on your value in the
:ref:`SelfCheckoutByLogin <selfcheckoutbylogin-label>` system preference 
you will be asked to enter you cardnumber

|image592|

or your username and password

|image593|

Once you're logged in to the self check module you will be asked to scan
the items you are checking out

|image594|

As you scan items they will appear below the barcode box

|image595|

When you are finished scanning items it is important to click the
'Finish' button. This will prompt you to print a receipt and log you out
of the self check module.

|image596|

When attempting to check items out there are some instances where error
messages will appear and the patron will be directed to the librarian.
This will happen even if you are allowing overrides on circulation
functions. Only a librarian can override a circulation block and so
patrons must go to the librarian for help in these situations.

|image597|

.. _self-checkin-label:

Self check-in
------------------------------------------------

In order to use the self check-in module, you must first set the :ref:
`SelfCheckInModule <selfscheckinmodule-label>` system preference to
'Enable'.

Then, you will have to :ref:`create a patron <add-a-staff-patron-label>` 
with the :ref:`self\_checkin\_module permission
<granular-self-check-permissions-label>`.

    **Note**

    Create a :ref:`staff patron <add-a-staff-patron-label>` specifically for this
    action so that you don't leave a real staff client logged into a
    computer all day. You can give this patron only the aforementionned 
    permission so it cannot be used for anything else.

Once this is done, you can head over to the self check-in page:
http://YOUR\_KOHA\_OPAC\_URL/cgi-bin/koha/sci/sci-main.pl

Log in with your staff patron with self check-in permissions

Once the computer or kiosk is set and the self check-in user logged in,
patrons will be able to check-in their items themselves.

|image1331|

The patron will either scan the item's barcode, if the computer is 
attached to a barcode scanner, or type in their item's barcode in the box
and click 'Add' or press enter.

    **Note**

    Most barcode scanners will automatically hit return after scanning.

Once they have scanned or entered all their items' barcodes, they can 
click on the 'Check-in' button to return all the items at once.

    **Important**

    If the patron doesn't click the 'Check-in' button, the items will not
    be returned and will stay in their account.

    **Important**

    The self check-in module will not warn user if the item is late, if 
    they have fines, if the item is on hold for someone else, or if they 
    have messages in their account.

|image1332|

They can then click 'Finish' to return to the main self check-in page.

|image1333|

    **Note**

    If the patron doesn't click 'Finish', the screen will refresh after the
    timeout period specified in the :ref:`SelfCheckInTimeout
    <selfcheckintimeout-label>` system preference.

    **Note**

    Even if the patron doesn't click 'Finish' the item will still be checked 
    in from their account.

You can cutomize the look of your self check-in screens by using the 
:ref:`SelfCheckInUserCSS <selfcheckinusercss-label>` system preference or
the :ref:`SelfCheckInUserJS <selfcheckinuserjs-label>` system preference.

You can add content, like instructions on how to use the self check-in system
for example, by using the :ref:`SelfCheckInMainUserBlock
<selfcheckinmainuserblock-label>` system preference.

Statistics about the transactions made through the self check-in module
are logged into the action\_logs table in the Koha database. You can therefore
:ref:`build a custom report <custom-reports-label>` to get the statistics you
need.

.. _offline-circulation-utilities-label:

Offline circulation utilities
------------------------------------------------

Koha allows for you to continue circulation actions while offline by
using any one of three utilities.

.. _offline-circulation-in-koha-label:

Offline circulation in Koha
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the :ref:`AllowOfflineCirculation` preference
is set to 'Enable' the library staff can continue to perform circulation
actions within Koha when the system is offline. You will want to visit
http://your-koha-staff-client-url/cgi-bin/koha/circ/offline.pl at least
once while online and bookmark that page. That is the page you will go
to when you are offline.

    **Important**

    The offline interface uses HTML LocalStorage, which depending on the
    browser and user setting, is limited to 2.5MB or 5MB per domain.
    This means that larger systems will not be able to synchronize their
    data and are recommended to use either the
    :ref:`Firefox <firefox-plugin-label>` or
    :ref:`Windows <offline-circ-tool-for-windows-label>` application for offline
    circulation.

.. _setup-label:

Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the first time the system goes offline go to Circulation and
choose 'Built-in offline circulation interface'

|image598|

And synchronize your data on every circulation computer by clicking the
'Synchronize' link on the right of the screen.

|image599|

    **Important**

    The offline interface uses HTML LocalStorage, which depending on the
    browser and user setting, is limited to 2.5MB or 5MB per domain.
    This means that larger systems will not be able to synchronize their
    data and are recommended to use either the
    :ref:`Firefox <firefox-plugin-label>` or
    :ref:`Windows <offline-circ-tool-for-windows-label>` application for offline
    circulation.

This will allow you download a local copy of your patrons and
circulation data. Click the 'Download records' link at the top of the
page to synchronize your data.

|image600|

Once your data is downloaded you will see the dates your data was last
synced to the right of each data set.

|image1261|

This should be done regularly in preparation for any unexpected connection losses.

.. _circulating-label:

Circulating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When your system goes offline visit the Offline Circulation page
(http://your-koha-staff-client-url/cgi-bin/koha/circ/offline.pl) in Koha
and click 'Check out' or 'Check in' to perform offline actions.

Checking out is done by searching for the patron by barcode or name at
the top of the 'Check out' screen. After selecting a patron you will be
presented with the synced patron info, including fines and check outs.

|image601|

Scan the barcode of the item you would like to check out and enter a due
date. If you don't enter a due date Koha will prompt you for one.

|image602|

Once the item is checked out it will appear below the patron's info.

|image603|

.. _koha-offline-uploading-label:

Koha offline uploading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the system is back online visit the 'Synchronize' page on the Offline
circulation module and click 'Upload transactions'

|image604|

After the files are uploaded you can click 'View pending offline
circulation actions' on the right.

|image605|

After clicking 'View pending offline circulation actions' you will be
brought to a summary of all of the actions you loaded in to Koha in your
\*.koc file.

|image606|

-  Once all of the logs from all of the circulation computers are loaded
   you will be able to check them all or select just those you want to
   process into Koha.

-  Click on the 'Process' button and Koha will record every stored
   transaction one by one. For each transaction, the status will change
   to:

   -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

   -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

   -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

   -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

Once finished you will have a summary of all of your transactions

|image607|

.. _firefox-plugin-label:

Firefox plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an offline circulation tool that you can add to your Firefox
browser as an addon. To do so, just go to
https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/koct/ page and click on the
"install now" button. You may have to confirm the installation, just
click on "install now" and then restart Firefox to complete the
installation.

Once you have installed the plugins and restarted Firefox, you will see
the Koha logo in the download bar at the bottom right of Firefox.

|image608|

A click on the logo will open the tool in its own window.

|image609|

The plugin consists of four tabs:

-  The 'Check out' tab is where you check out items

-  The 'Check in' tab is where you check in items

-  The 'Log' tab keeps track of every transaction done while in offline
   mode

   -  The log will keep information until you empty it. Each time you
      open the plugin and it contains data in the log it will warn you

      |image610|

      If you'd like to clear the log, check the 'I want to delete rows'
      box before hitting the 'OK' button. Otherwise clicking 'OK' will
      keep the items in the log and let you continue working with the
      tool.

-  The 'Param' tab is to set up the plugin

The first thing you want to do then is to set up the plugin. Go to the
'Param' tab to set up the plugin

|image611|

Answer the 4 questions presented:

-  Server = the URL of the librarian interface

-  Branch code = the code for the branch where you are located

-  Username = your staff account login

-  Password = your staff account password

    **Important**

    To save the settings, you will have to close the plugin window and
    re-open it by clicking again on the Koha logo in the add-on bar.

    **Note**

    You can create a staff account dedicated to the offline circulation.
    So that, no matter who is at the circulation desk, they can all use
    the same login. Along those lines, you can use a group login that
    you already have in place for circulation as well.

Once you have everything set up you can start checking items in and out.

Checking out:

|image612|

-  Go to the 'Check out' tab

-  Scan the patron barcode

-  Scan the item barcode

-  Click 'Save'

Checking in:

|image613|

-  Go to the 'Check in' tab

-  Scan the item barcode

-  Click 'Save'

Each time, you check out or check in an item, a new transaction is
recorded in the local plugin database and you will see, at the bottom of
the plugin how many transactions has been made during the offline
circulation. For example, "10 row(s) added" means you did 10
transactions.

|image614|

Then, if you want an overview of every transaction, go to the Log tab.
This tab will show you the transactions in the plugin database

|image615|

    **Note**

    The status will be "Local." as long as you are offline and don't
    process the transactions into Koha.

When your Internet connection comes back up you will want to get these
transactions in to Koha. Before processing these transactions you should
be aware of a few issues.

Because you are not connected to your Koha database when using this
plugin holds will need additional processing. If an item you check in
while offline has a hold, the hold is kept on the item. Since, you can't
confirm holds found during the processing of every check in, the holds
stay on the item and will need to be managed later. If you only checked
in a few items you can just keep a record of them all. If you checked in
a lot of items you can use the Holds queue once it rebuilds to see what
holds made it to the shelf erroneously.

Similarly, if an patron card was expired, the offline circulation tool
won't know about it, so the checkout will be recorded regardless of the
patron's account being blocked normally.

You have two options for adding this data to Koha

-  Commit to Koha

   -  If you checked in/out on more than one computer at the same time,
      what you want is to process every transaction consistently. Let's
      say for instance that one patron checked a book out on one
      computer and then checked the same book in on another computer. To
      be consistent, you need to record the check out first and then the
      check in. Not the opposite! To do so, you need to group every
      transaction in one place, sort them all and then, process
      everything. So, you need to use the "Commit to Koha" option from
      every plugin/computer you worked with. This way, the log will go
      to Koha and be accessible from the Offline Circulation page.

      |image616|

   -  *Get there:* Circulation > Pending offline circulation actions

      |image617|

   -  Once all of the logs from all of the circulation computers are
      loaded you will be able to check them all or select just those you
      want to process into Koha.

   -  Click on the Process button and Koha will record every stored
      transaction one by one. For each transaction, the status will
      change to:

      -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

      -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

      -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

      -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

   -  Once finished you will have a summary of all of your transactions

      |image618|

-  Apply directly

   -  If you performed all of the circulation actions on one computer
      then everything is sorted already so you can choose to "Apply
      directly"

   -  The status column will be updated to let you know if the
      transactions were applied

      -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

      -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

      -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

      -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

   -  Once you're finished you can review all of the items right in the
      Log tab

      |image619|

Once you are done you can clear the log by clicking Clear. If you don't
you will be warned the next time you open the Offline circulation tool.

|image620|

.. _offline-circ-tool-for-windows-label:

Offline circ tool for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Offline circulation utility can be downloaded at:
https://github.com/bywatersolutions/koha-offline-circulation/releases

To generate a borrowers.db file for loading in to the Windows tool you
will need to run the :ref:`file generator via a cron
job <generate-patron-file-for-offline-circulation-label>`.

.. _upload-offline-circ-file-label:

Upload offline circ file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`offline circulation tool for Windows <offline-circ-tool-for-windows-label>` will
generate a KOC file that you can upload into Koha once your system comes
back up.

On the Circulation menu click 'Upload offline circulation file (.koc)'

|image621|

Browse your computer for the \*.koc file

|image622|

Once the file is uploaded, click the process the file

|image623|

When this is complete you'll be able to upload another file or tend to
pending offline circulation actions.

|image624|

After clicking 'View pending offline circulation actions' you will be
brought to a summary of all of the actions you loaded in to Koha in your
\*.koc file.

|image625|

-  Once all of the logs from all of the circulation computers are loaded
   you will be able to check them all or select just those you want to
   process into Koha.

-  Click on the Process button and Koha will record every stored
   transaction one by one. For each transaction, the status will change
   to:
