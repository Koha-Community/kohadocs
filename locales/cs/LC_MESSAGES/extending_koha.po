"git.bywatersolutions.com/koha-plugins.git/shortlog/refs/heads/cover_flow>`__ "

msgid ""
"First, you need to create one or more public reports for your coverflow "
"widget or widgets to be based on. This is how the plugin knows what the "
"content of your widget should contain. Each report needs only three columns; "
"title, biblionumber, and isbn. It is important that you have a good and "
"valid isbn, as that is the datum used to actually fetch the cover. In the "
"iteration of the plugin, we are using Amazon cover images, but I believe in "
"the end I will make the cover image fetcher configurable so we can use any "
"data source for cover image fetching."

"Second, we need to configure the plugin. The plugin configuration is a "

"YAML ) to store the configuration options. In this example it looks like "
"this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending_koha.rst:193
msgid ""
"In this example, we are telling the plugin to use the report with id 42, and "
"use it to create a coverflow widget to replace the HTML element with the id "
"“coverflow”. The options list is passed directly to Flipster, so any options "
"supported by Flipster can be set from the plugin configuration! In fact, in "
"addition to the traditional coverflow, Flipster has a “carousel” mode which "
"is a much more compact version of the coverflow. You can also configure "
"which cover the widget will start on, among other options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending_koha.rst:202

"At the time the plugins options are saved or updated, the plugin will then "

"Koha system preference OPACUserJS. Here is an example of the output:"

"Why do this? For speed! Rather than regenerating this code each and every "
"time the page loads, we can generate it once, and use it over and over again."

#: ../../source/extending_koha.rst:218
msgid ""
"If you inspect the code closely, you’ll notice it references a script "
"“coverflow.pl”. This is a script that is included with the coverflow plugin. "
"Since we need to access this from the OPAC ( and we don’t want to set off "
"any XSS attack alarms ), we need to modify the web server configuration for "
"the public catalog and add the followup to it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/extending_koha.rst:228

"This line gives us access to the coverflow.pl script from the OPAC. This "
