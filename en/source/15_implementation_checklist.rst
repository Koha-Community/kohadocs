Implementation Checklist
========================

The following guide will walk you through the areas of Koha you need to
look at in order to prepare to start using the system.

.. _data-migration-label:

Data Migration
-----------------------------------

Before you can start using Koha you'll need to have some data. This can
be done by entering it all by hand, but most people already have their
data in electronic format of some sort and just need to reformat it a
bit for importing into Koha.

-  Create a list of libraries and enter their info and codes into
   :ref:`Libraries & Groups`

-  Define your list of :ref:`Item Types`

-  Define your patron categories and enter the categories and their
   codes into :ref:`Patron Categories`

-  Enter any additional patron information fields you use in your
   library in the :ref:`Patron Attributes <patron-attribute-types-label>`

   -  Requires that you first set the
      :ref:`ExtendedPatronAttributes` system
      preference if you have custom fields

-  Define all of your :ref:`Authorized Values`

   -  `Collection codes <#ccode>`__

   -  `Shelving locations <#shelvelocvals>`__

   -  Item statuses (`lost <#lost>`__, `not for loan <#notforloan>`__,
      `damaged <#damageauth>`__, `withdrawn <#withdrawnauth>`__)

   -  Plus any others that are needed in your library

-  Optionally define :ref:`City/State/Postal Code <cities-and-towns-label>` combos

-  :ref:`Map your bibliographic data <koha-to-marc-mapping-label>` from your legacy
   system to Koha fields and migrate (remembering to use the collection,
   shelving, item type and library codes you entered in the above
   setting areas)

-  :ref:`Map your patron data <patron-import-label>` from your legacy system to
   the Koha fields and migrate (remembering to use the patron and
   library codes you defined above)

-  Test your migrated data to be sure that everything is as you expect
   it to be, some things to test include:

   -  Check some of your titles with diacritics and make sure that they
      migrated properly.

   -  Check titles in a series and make sure that series information
      migrated properly.

   -  Make sure that your patrons have their contact information in the
      right fields.

   -  If your serials data was migrated search for these records in the
      catalog and confirm that they look right.

   -  If your serials data was migrated search for these records in the
      serials module and confirm that they look right.

   -  Check marc records to verify a variety of items are cataloged
      correctly

   -  Check cataloging process to see if all necessary fields are
      available

   -  If fines are migrated, check to see that they are applied
      correctly

   -  If holds are migrated, check to see they are accurate in catalog
      and patron record

Most of these preferences won't need to be changed to use your Koha
system, but there are a few that you might want to customize.

   various :ref:`CAS system preferences <cas-authentication-label>`

      show item type icons in the staff client and opac

      preferences.

   can do the training themselves.

   system and get comfortable with it

   data right before you go live

   plan
