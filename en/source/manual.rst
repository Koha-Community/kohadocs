`Patron Import <#patronimport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patrons and Circulation > Import Patrons

The patron import tool can be used at any time to add patrons in bulk.
It is commonly used in universities and schools when a new batch of
students registers.

`Creating Patron File <#createpatronfile>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your Koha installation comes with a blank CSV file that you can use as a
template for your patron records. If you would like to create the file
yourself, make sure that your file has the following fields in this
order as the header row:

cardnumber, surname, firstname, title, othernames, initials,
streetnumber, streettype, address, address2, city, state, zipcode,
country, email, phone, mobile, fax, emailpro, phonepro, B\_streetnumber,
B\_streettype, B\_address, B\_address2, B\_city, B\_state, B\_zipcode,
B\_country, B\_email, B\_phone, dateofbirth, branchcode, categorycode,
dateenrolled, dateexpiry, gonenoaddress, lost, debarred,
debarredcomment, contactname, contactfirstname, contacttitle,
guarantorid, borrowernotes, relationship, ethnicity, ethnotes, sex,
password, flags, userid, opacnote, contactnote, sort1, sort2,
altcontactfirstname, altcontactsurname, altcontactaddress1,
altcontactaddress2, altcontactaddress3, altcontactstate,
altcontactzipcode, altcontactcountry, altcontactphone, smsalertnumber,
privacy, patron\_attributes

    **Important**

    The 'password' should be stored in plaintext, and will be converted
    to a Bcrypt hash.

    If your passwords are already encrypted, talk to your systems
    administrator about options

    **Important**

    Date formats should match your `system preference <#dateformat>`__,
    and must be zero-padded, e.g. '01/02/2008'.

    **Important**

    The fields 'branchcode', 'categorycode' and all fields you have
    defined in the `BorrowerMandatoryField <#BorrowerMandatoryField>`__
    preference are required and must match valid entries in your
    database.

    **Note**

    If loading `patron attributes <#patronattributetypes>`__, the
    'patron\_attributes' field should contain a comma-separated list of
    attribute types and values.

    -  The attribute type code and a colon should precede each value.

       -  For example: "INSTID:12345,BASEBALL:Cubs"

       -  This field must be wrapped in quotes if multiple values are
          defined.

       -  Since values can contain spaces, additional doubled-quotes may
          be required:

          -  "INSTID:12345,BASEBALL:Cubs,""BASEBALL:White Sox"""

       -  When replacing a patron record, any attributes specified in
          the input file replace all of the attribute values of any type
          that were previously assigned to the patron record.

`Importing Patrons <#importpatrons>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have created your file, you can use the Patron Import Tool to
bring the data into Koha.

-  Choose your CSV file

   Import Patron Form
   |image255|

-  Choose to match on 'Cardnumber' or 'Username' to prevent adding of
   duplicate card numbers to the system

   Patron match options
   |image256|

-  Next you can choose default values to apply to all patrons you are
   importing

   -  ex. If you're importing patrons specific to one branch you can use
      the field on the Import form to apply the branch code to all those
      you are importing.

-  Finally you need to decide on what data you want to replace if there
   are duplicates.

   If match found
   |image257|

   -  A matching record is found using the field you chose for matching
      criteria to prevent duplication

   -  If you included patron attributes in your file you can decide
      whether to add your values to existing values or erase existing
      values and enter only your new values.

`Notices & Slips <#notices>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patrons and Circulation > Notices & Slips

All notices and circulation receipts (or slips) generated by Koha can be
customized using the Notices & Slips Tool. The system comes with several
predefined templates that will appear when you first visit this tool.

Notices & Slips Tool
|image258|

Each notice can be edited, but only a few can be deleted, this is to
prevent system errors should a message try to send without a template.
Each notice and slip can be edited on a per library basis, by default
you will see the notices for all libraries.

If you have a style you'd like applied to all slips you can point the
`SlipCSS <#SlipCSS>`__ preference to a stylesheet. The same is true for
notices, using the `NoticeCSS <#NoticeCSS>`__ preference to define a
stylesheet.

You will also want to review the `Notices & Slips Field
Guide <#noticesfieldguide>`__ for more information on formatting these
notices.

`Adding Notices & Slips <#addnotices>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new notice or slip

-  Click 'New Notice'

   New Notice Form
   |image259|

-  Choose which library this notice or slip is for

   -  **Important**

          Not all notices can be branch specific for more information
          review the `Notices & Slips Field
          Guide <#noticesfieldguide>`__ in this manual.

-  Choose the module this notice is related to

-  The Code is limited to 20 characters

   -  **Important**

          When working with the overdue notices you want each notice at
          each branch to have a unique code. Think about using the
          branch code in front of the notice code for each branch.

-  Use the name field to expand on your Code

   -  **Note**

          With overdue notices, be sure to put your branch name in the
          description as well so that it will be visible when setting up
          your `triggers <#noticetriggers>`__.

-  Next you can customize the notice for every possible delivery method

   -  Every notice should have an Email template set for itNew Email
      notice

   -  If you're using the
      `TalkingTechItivaPhoneNotification <#TalkingTechItivaPhoneNotification>`__
      service you can set up a Phone notificationNew Phone notice

   -  If you plan on printing this notice you can set the Print template
      nextNew Print notice

   -  If you have enabled SMS notices with the
      `SMSSendDriver <#SMSSendDriver>`__ preference you can set the text
      for your SMS notices nextNew SMS notice

-  Each notice offers you the same options

   -  If you plan on writing the notice or slip in HTML check the 'HTML
      Message' box, otherwise the content will be generated as plain
      text

   -  Message Subject is what will appear in the subject line of the
      email

   -  In the message body feel free to type whatever message you feel is
      best, use the fields on the left hand side to enter individualized
      data from the from database.

      -  **Note**

             Review the `Notices & Slip Field
             Guide <#noticesfieldguide>`__ for info on what fields can
             be used here.

      -  **Important**

             Overdue notices can use <<items.content>> tags by
             themselves, or use <item></item> to span all of the tags.
             Learn more about the `Overdue Notice
             Markup <#noticemarkup>`__

             -  On overdue notices make sure to use <<items.content>>
                tags to print out the data related to all items that are
                overdue.

             -  The other option, only for overdue notices, is to use
                the <item></item> tags to span the line so that it will
                print out multiple lines One example for the
                <item></item> tag option is:

                <item>"<<biblio.title>>" by <<biblio.author>>,
                <<items.itemcallnumber>>, Barcode: <<items.barcode>> ,
                Checkout date: <<issues.issuedate>>, Due date:
                <<issues.date\_due>> Fine: <<items.fine>> Due date:
                <<issues.date\_due>> </item>

      -  **Important**

             Only the overdue notices take advantage of the
             <item></item> tags, all other notices referencing items
             need to use <<items.content>>

      -  **Note**

             To add today's date you can use the <<today>> syntax

      -  **Note**

             If you don't want to print the patron's full name on your
             slips or notice you can enter data in the Other name or
             Initials field for each patron and use that value instead.

`Overdue Notice Markup <#noticemarkup>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When creating your overdue notices there are two tags in addition to the
various database fields that you can use in your notices. You will also
want to review the `Notices & Slips Field Guide <#noticesfieldguide>`__
for information on formatting item information in these notices.

    **Important**

    These new tags only work on the overdue notices, not other
    circulation related notices at this time.

These tags are <item> and </item> which should enclose all fields from
the biblio, biblioitems, and items tables.

An example of using these tags in a notice template might be like:

::

       The following item(s) is/are currently overdue:

       <item>"<<biblio.title>>" by <<biblio.author>>, <<items.itemcallnumber>>, Barcode: <<items.barcode>> Fine: <<items.fine>></item>

Which, assuming two items were overdue, would result in a notice like:

::

       The following item(s) is/are currently overdue:

       "A Short History of Western Civilization" by Harrison, John B, 909.09821 H2451, Barcode: 08030003 Fine: 3.50
       "History of Western Civilization" by Hayes, Carlton Joseph Huntley, 909.09821 H3261 v.1, Barcode: 08030004 Fine: 3.50

`Overdue Notice/Status Triggers <#noticetriggers>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patrons and Circulation > Overdue
   Notice/Status Triggers

In order to send the overdue notices that you defined using the
`Notices <#notices>`__ tool, you need to first set the triggers to have
these messages.

    **Important**

    In order to have overdue notices sent to your patrons, you need to
    `set that patron category <#addingpatroncat>`__ to require overdue
    notices.

    **Important**

    Depending on the value of your
    `OverdueNoticeCalendar <#OverdueNoticeCalendar>`__ preference the
    delay may or may not include days the library is closed based on the
    `holiday calendar <#calholidays>`__.

The Overdue Notice/Status Triggers tool gives the librarian the power to
send up to three notices to each patron type notifying them of overdue
items

Overdue Notice/Status Triggers Tool
|image260|

-  Delay is the number of days after an issue is due before an action is
   triggered.

   -  **Important**

          If you want Koha to trigger an action (send a letter or
          restrict member), a delay value is required.

-  To send additional notices, click on the tabs for 'Second' and
   'Third' notice

-  If you would like to prevent a patron from checking items out because
   of their overdue items, check the 'Restrict' box, this will put a
   notice on the patron's record at checkout informing the librarian
   that the patron cannot check out due to overdue items.

   -  If you choose to restrict a patron in this way you can also have
      Koha automatically remove that restriction with the
      `AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions <#AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions>`__
      preference.

-  Next you can choose the delivery method for the overdue notice. You
   can choose from Email, Phone (if you are using the `iTiva Talking
   Tech service <#TalkingTechItivaPhoneNotification>`__), Print and SMS
   (if you have set your `SMSSendDriver <#SMSSendDriver>`__).

   -  **Note**

          The Feed option is not yet a feature in Koha, it is there for
          future development.

-  See a `Sample Overdue Notice <#samplenotice>`__

`Patron Card Creator <#patroncardcreator>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   something that will be easy to identify at a later date

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for your layout.

   Units of Measurement
   |image262|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72" an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  Next note if this layout is for the front or the back of the patron
   card

   -  **Note**

          You will need a layout for both the front and back of your
          card if you have 2-sided library cards, this option doesn't
          allow you to print two sided cards, just lets you track which
          side of the card you're designing.

-  You have the option of adding up to 3 lines of text to your card.
   Your text can be static text of your choosing and/or fields from the
   patron record. If you want to print fields from the patron record you
   want to put the field names in brackets like so - <firstname>

   -  **Note**

          A full list of field names can be found in the database schema
          at http://schema.koha-community.org

-  For each line of text, you can choose your font, font size and the
   location of the text on the card using the lower X and Y coordinates

-  In order to show the barcode and the patron card number you will need
   to check the 'Print Card Number as Barcode' option. This will turn
   the patron card number into a barcode. If you want the number to
   print in human readable format you will need to check the 'Print Card
   Number as Text Under Barcode' option.

-  Finally you can choose up to two images to print on the card.

   -  One can be the `patron image <#uploadpatronimages>`__ which you
      can resize to meet your needs.

   -  The other image can be something like a library logo or symbol
      that you uploaded using the '`Manage
      Images <#managecardimages>`__' module of the Patron Card Creator
      Tool.

    **Important**

    It is the designers responsibility to define textlines, barcode and
    images such that overlap is avoided.

After saving, your layouts will appear on the 'Manage layouts' page.

`Templates <#patrontemplate>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron Card Creator > Manage > Card
   templates

A template describes the arrangement of labels on the label sheet/card
stock you are using. This might be Avery 5160 for address labels,
Gaylord 47-284 for spine labels or Avery 28371 for your patron cards,
just to give a couple of examples. All of the information you will need
for setting up a template may be on the packaging, and if not it can
usually be found on the vendor's website or can be measured from a
sample sheet.

`Add a Template <#addcardtemplate>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new template click on the 'New template' button at the top of
your page which brings you to the Edit template form immediately. You
may also choose to press 'Manage templates' on the left side. Here you
are offered a list of available templates you can select for editing.
But in the top of the page there is still the 'New template' button.

New template button
|image264|

Using the form that appears after pressing either 'Edit' or 'New
template'you can define the template for your sheet of labels or cards.

Add Patron Card Template
|image265|

-  Template ID is simply a system generated unique id

-  Template Code should be the name of this template to identify it on a
   list of templates

-  You can use the Template Description to add additional information
   about the template

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for the template.

   Measurement Units
   |image266|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72" an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  The measurements (page height, page width, card width, card height)
   may be on the packaging, and if not it can usually be found on the
   vendor's website or can be measured from a sample sheet.

-  A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given template just
   prior to printing which compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar
   to a given printer (to which the profile is assigned).

   -  Before defining a profile try printing some sample cards so that
      you can take measurements to define a profile to perform the right
      adjustments for your printer/template combination.

   -  After finding and documenting any anomalies in the printed
      document, then you can `create a profile <#addcardprofile>`__ and
      assign it to the template.

   -  **Important**

          Do not specify a profile unless needed, i.e. do not click to
          define a printer profile. It is not possible to remove a
          profile from a template but you can switch to another profile.

   -  **Note**

          If you are using different printers you may be required to
          define several templates that are identical only different
          profiles are specified.

After saving, your templates will appear on the 'Manage templates' page.

`Profiles <#patronprofile>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron Card Creator > Manage > Profiles

A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given
`template <#patrontemplate>`__ just prior to printing which compensates
for anomalies unique and peculiar to a given printer. This means if you
set a template up and then print a sample set of data and find that the
items are not all aligned the same on each card, you need to set up a
profile for each printer (or even different tray selections on the same
printer) to make up for the differences in printing styles, such as the
shifting of text to the left, right, top or bottom.

If your cards are printing just the way you want, you will not need a
profile.

`Add a Profile <#addcardprofile>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new profile, you want to click on the 'Profiles' button at the
top of your page and choose 'New Profile'

New Profile Button
|image268|

To add a new profile, you want to click on the 'New profile' button at
the top of your page. Using the form that appears you can define the
values to correct the card misalignments on your label sheet. You may
also choose 'Manage profiles' on the left side and select one of the
currently available profiles for editing.

Add Printer Profile
|image269|

-  The Printer Name and Paper Bin do not have to match your printer
   exactly, they are for your reference so you can remember what printer
   you have set the profile for.

   -  **Note**

          For example: if you want to use the Printer model number in
          printer name you can, or you can call it 'the printer on my
          desk'

-  Template will be filled in once you have chosen which template to
   apply the profile to on the `template edit form <#addcardtemplate>`__

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for your profile.

   Units of Measurement
   |image270|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72" an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  Offset should be used when the entire image is off center either
   vertically or horizontally. Creep describes a condition where the
   distance between the labels changes across the page or up and down
   the page

   -  For offset and creep values, negative numbers move the printed
      information up and to the left on the printed sheet and positive
      numbers move down and to the right

   -  Example: the text is printed 0 .25" from the left edge of the
      first label, 0 .28" from the left edge of the second label and 0
      .31" from the left edge of the third label. This means the
      horizontal creep should be set to (minus) -0.03 " to make up for
      this difference.

After saving, your profiles will appear on the 'Manage Printer Profiles'
page.

Once you have saved your new profile, you can return to the list of
templates and choose to edit the template that this profile is for.

`Rotating Collections <#rotatingcollections>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Rotating Collections

Rotating Collections is a tool for managing collections of materials
that frequently get shifted from library to library. It adds the ability
to store not only an item's home library and current location but also
information about where it is supposed to be transferred to next to
ensure that all items in the collection are sent to the correct library.
When an item in a rotating collection is checked in, library staff is
notified that the item is part of a rotating collection and which branch
it should be sent to if it is not at the correct one.

    **Important**

    The `AutomaticItemReturn <#AutomaticItemReturn>`__ system preference
    must be set to "Don't automatically transfer items to their home
    library when they are returned" for Rotating Collections to function
    properly.

-  To create a new rotating collection, click the "New Collection"
   button, fill in the Title and Description, and click Submit. Once
   submitted you'll see "Collection Name added successfully"; click
   "Return to rotating collections home" to return to the main Rotating
   Collections management page (or click Rotating Collections in the
   sidebar).

-  To add items to a collection, click "Add or remove items" next to the
   collection's name in the list of collections. Under "Add or remove
   items" scan or type in the barcode of the item you wish to add to the
   collection, and hit Enter or click Submit if necessary.

-  To remove an item from a collection, either click Remove next to the
   item's barcode in the list of items within the collection or check
   the "Remove item from collection" box next to the Barcode text box
   under "Add or remove items, and scan or type in the barcode, clicking
   Submit or hitting Enter if necessary. Note: The "Remove item from
   collection" checkbox will remain checked as long as you are on the
   "Add or remove items" page, unless you uncheck it, to facilitate
   quickly removing a number of items at a time by scanning their
   barcodes.

`Transfer a Rotating Collection <#transferrotatingcollection>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transferring a collection will:

-  Change the current location of the items in that collection to the
   library it is to be transferred to

-  Initiate a transfer from its original current location/holding
   library to the current location/holding library it is to be rotated
   to. When a library receives a collection they will need to check in
   the items to complete the transfer.

You can transfer a collection in one of two ways:

-  From the main Rotating Collections page, click on Transfer next to
   the title of the collection you wish to transfer; choose the library
   you wish to transfer the collection to and click "Transfer
   collection".

-  Or, from the "add or remove items" page for a collection, you can
   click the Transfer button, choose the library you wish to transfer
   the collection to and click "Transfer Collection".

    **Important**

    In order to complete the transfer process, the library receiving the
    rotating collection should check in all items from the collection as
    they receive them. This will clear the transfer so that the items
    are no longer shown as being "in transit".

If an item in a rotating collection is checked in at a library other
than the one it is supposed to be transferred to, a notification will
appear notifying library staff that the item is part of a rotating
collection, also letting them know where the item needs to be sent.

`Inventory/Stocktaking <#inventory>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Inventory/Stocktaking

Koha's Inventory Tool can be used in one of two ways, the first is by
printing out a shelf list that you can then mark items off on, or by
uploading a text files of barcodes gathered by a portable scanner.

If you do not have the ability to use your barcode scanner on the floor
of the library, the first option available to you is to generate a shelf
list based on criteria you enter.

Inventory & Stocktaking Tool
|image315|

Choose which library, shelving location, call number range, item status
and when the item was last seen to generate a shelf list that you can
then print to use while walking around the library checking your
collection

Shelf List
|image316|

Alternatively you can export the list to a CSV file for altering in an
application on your desktop. Simply check the box next to 'Export to csv
file' to generate this file.

Once you have found the items on your shelves you can return to this
list and check off the items you found to have the system update the
last seen date to today.

If you have a portable scanner (or a laptop and USB scanner) you can
walk through the library with the scanner in hand and scan barcodes as
you come across them. Once finished you can then upload the text file
generated by the scanner to Koha

Choose the text file and the date you want to mark all items as seen and
then scroll to the very bottom and click 'Submit.'

`Label Creator <#labelcreator>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Label Creator

The Label Creator allow you to use layouts and templates which you
design to print a nearly unlimited variety of labels including barcodes.
Here are some of the features of the Label Creator module:

-  Customize label layouts

-  Design custom label templates for printed labels

-  Build and manage batches of labels

-  Export single or multiple batches

-  Export single or multiple labels from within a batch

-  Export label data in one of three formats:

   -  PDF - Readable by any standard PDF reader, making labels printable
      directly on a printer

   -  CSV - Export label data after your chosen layout is applied
      allowing labels to be imported in to a variety of applications

   -  XML - Included as an alternate export format

`Templates <#labeltemplates>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Label Creator > Manage > Label templates

A template is based on the label/card stock you are using. This might be
Avery 5160 for address labels, Gaylord 47-284 for spine labels or Avery
28371 for your patron cards, just to give a couple of examples. These
labels will include all of the information you will need for setting up
a Koha, this information may be on the packaging, and if not it can
usually be found on the vendor's website.

`Add a Template <#addlabeltemplate>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new template, you want to click on the 'New' button at the top
of the Label Creator and choosing 'Label template'.

New Label Template Option
|image318|

Using the form that appears you can define the template for your sheet
of labels or cards.

Label Template Form
|image319|

-  Template ID will be automatically generated after saving your
   template, this is simply a system generated unique id

-  Template Code should be something you can use to identify your
   template on a list of templates

-  You can use the Template Description to add additional information
   about the template

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for the template. This should probably match the
   unit of measurement used on the template description provided by the
   product vendor.

   Measurement Units
   |image320|

-  The measurements, number of columns and number of rows can be found
   on the vendor product packaging or website.

   -  **Important**

          If you do not supply a left text margin in the template, a
          3/16" (13.5 point) left text margin will apply by default.

-  A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given template just
   prior to printing which compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar
   to a given printer (to which the profile is assigned).

   -  Before picking a profile try printing some sample labels so that
      you can easily define a profile that is right for your
      printer/template combination.

   -  After finding any anomalies in the printed document, `create a
      profile <#addlabelprofile>`__ and assign it to the template.

After saving, your templates will appear on the 'Manage' area under
'Label templates'.

List of label templates
|image321|

`Profiles <#labelprofiles>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Label Creator > Manage > Printer Profiles

A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given
`template <#addlabeltemplate>`__ just prior to printing which
compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar to a given printer (to
which the profile is assigned). This means if you set a template up and
then print a sample set of data and find that the items are not all
aligned the same on each label, you need to set up a profile for each
printer to make up for the differences in printing styles, such as the
shifting of text to the left, right, top or bottom.

If your labels are printing just the way you want, you will not need a
profile.

`Add a Profile <#addlabelprofile>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new profile, you want to click on the 'New' button at the top
of the Label Creator tool and choose 'Printer profile'.

New Profile Button
|image322|

Using the form that appears you can create a profile to fix any problems
with your template.

Create a Printer Profile
|image323|

-  The Printer Name and Paper Bin do not have to match your printer
   exactly, they are for your reference so you can remember what printer
   you have set the profile for. So if you want to use the Printer model
   number in printer name or you can call it 'the printer on my desk'

-  Template will be filled in once you have chosen which template to
   apply the profile to on the `template edit
   form <#addlabeltemplate>`__

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for your profile.

   Units of Measurement
   |image324|

-  Offset describes what happens when the entire image is off center
   either vertically or horizontally and creep describes a condition
   where the distance between the labels changes across the page or up
   and down the page

   -  For these values, negative numbers move the error up and to the
      left and positive numbers move the error down and to the right

   -  Example: the text is .25" from the left edge of the first label,
      .28" from the left edge of the second label and .31" from the left
      edge of the third label. This means the horizontal creep should be
      set to .03" to make up for this difference.

After saving, your profiles will appear on the 'Manage' area under
'Printer profiles'.

List of Profiles
|image325|

Once you have saved your new profile, you can return to the list of
templates and choose to edit the template that this profile is for.

`Layouts <#labellayouts>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Label Creator > Manage > Layouts

A layout is used to define the fields you want to appear on your labels.

`Add a Layout <#addlabellayout>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new layout, you want to click on the 'New' button at the top of
the Label Creator tool and choose 'Layout'.

New Layout Button
|image326|

Using the form that appears you can create a profile to fix any problems
with your template.

Add New Layout
|image327|

-  The name of your layout can be anything you'd like to help you
   identify it later.

-  If this is a barcode label you'll want to choose the encoding (Code
   39 is the most common)

-  The layout type can be any combination of bibliographic information
   and/or barcode. For example a spine label would just be Biblio
   whereas a label for your circulation staff to use to checkout the
   book would probably be Biblio/Barcode.

-  The Bibliographic Data to Print includes any of the data fields that
   may be mapped to your MARC frameworks. You can choose from the preset
   list of fields or you can click on 'List Fields' and enter your own
   data. In 'List Fields', you can specify MARC subfields as a
   4-character tag-subfield string: (ie. 254a for the title field), You
   can also enclose a whitespace-separated list of fields to concatenate
   on one line in double quotes. (ie. "099a 099b" or "itemcallnumber
   barcode"). The fields available are from the database tables list
   below. Finally you could add in static text strings in single-quote
   (ie. 'Some static text here.')

   -  You can use the schema viewer (http://schema.koha-community.org)
      with the following tables to find field names to use:

      -  Currently all fields in the following tables are used: items,
         biblioitems, biblio, branches

         List fields
         |image328|

-  Choose if the label maker should print out the guidelines around each
   label

-  Choose if you'd like Koha to try to split your call numbers (usually
   used on Spine Labels)

-  Finally choose your text settings such as alignment, font type and
   size.

After saving, your layouts will appear on the 'Manage Layouts' page.

`Batches <#labelbatches>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Label Creator > Manage > Label batches

Batches are made up of the barcodes you would like to print. Once in
this tool you can search for the item records you would like to print
out labels for.

`Add a Batch <#addlabelbatch>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Batches can be created in one of two ways. The first is to click the
'Create Label Batch' link on the '`Staged MARC
Management <#managestaged>`__' page:

Create Label Batch Link on Staged Records List
|image329|

The other is to choose to create a new batch from the label creator tool

Create New Batch
|image330|

You will be brought to an empty batch with a box to scan barcodes or
itemnumbers in to and an 'Add item(s)' button at the bottom of the page.

Add Items
|image331|

You can either scan barcodes in to the box provided and click the 'Add
item(s)' button or you can click the 'Add item(s)' button with the
barcodes box empty. Clicking 'Add item(s)' with nothing in the barcodes
box will open a search window for you to find the items you want to add
to the batch.

Search for items for a Batch
|image332|

From the search results, click the check box next to the items you want
to add to the batch and click the 'Add checked' button. You can also add
items one by one by clicking the 'Add' link to the left of each item.

Batch search results
|image333|

Once you have added all of the items click the 'Done' button. The
resulting page will list the items you have selected.

List of items in the batch
|image334|

To print your labels, click the 'Export full batch' button. To print
only some of the labels, click the 'Export selected item(s)' button.
Either way you will be presented with a confirmation screen where you
can choose your template and layout.

Start batch export
|image335|

You will then be presented with three download options: PDF, Excel, and
CSV.

After saving your file, simply print to the blank labels you have in
your library.

`Quick Spine Label Creator <#quicklabelcreator>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Quick Spine Label Creator

    **Note**

    This tool does not use the label layouts or templates, it simply
    prints a spine label in the first spot on the label sheet.

    -  Define the fields you want to print on the spine label in the
       `SpineLabelFormat <#SpineLabelFormat>`__ system preference

    -  Format your label printing by editing spinelabel.css found in
       koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/css/

To use this tool you simply need the barcode for the book you'd like to
print the spine label for.

`MARC modification templates <#marcmodtemplates>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MARC Modification Templates system gives Koha users the power to
make alterations to MARC records automatically while staging MARC
records for import.

This tool is useful for altering MARC records from various
venders/sources work with your MARC framework. The system essentially
allows one to create a basic script using actions to Copy, Move, Add,
Update and Delete fields.

Start by adding a new template (a template can be made up of one or more
actions) by entering a name and clicking 'Create template'.

Add a new template
|image338|

Next you can add actions to the template by filling in the Action box.
For example if you're loading in a batch of files from your EBook vendor
you might want to add the biblio item type of EBOOK to the 942$c.Add
action

-  Choose 'Add/Update'

-  Enter the field 942 and subfield c

-  Enter the value of 'EBOOK' (or whatever your ebook item type code is)

-  Provide a description so you can identify this action later

-  Click 'Add action'

Each action can also have an optional condition to check the value or
existance of another field. For example you might want to add the call
number to the item record if it's not already there.

Add conditional action
|image339|

-  Choose 'Copy'

-  Decide if you want to copy the first occurance or all occurances of
   the field

-  Enter the field 090 (or other biblio call number field) and subfield
   a to copy

-  Enter the 952 field and o subfield to copy to

-  Choose 'if'

-  Enter the 952 field and o subfield

-  Choose "doesn't exist"

-  Provide a description so you can identify this action later

-  Click 'Add action'

The Copy & Move actions also support Regular Expressions, which can be
used to automatically modify field values during the copy/move. An
example would be to strip out the '$' character in field 020$c.

Add regex action
|image340|

-  Choose 'Copy and replace'

-  Decide if you want to copy the first occurance or all occurances of
   the field

-  Enter the field 020 and subfield c to copy

-  Enter the 020 field and c subfield to copy to

-  Check the 'RegEx' box and enter your regular expression (in this case
   s/\\$// )

-  Choose 'if'

-  Enter the 020 field and c subfield

-  Choose "matches"

-  Check the 'RegEx' box and enter your regular expression (in this case
   m/^\\$/ )

-  Provide a description so you can identify this action later

-  Click 'Add action'

    **Note**

    The value for an update can include variables that change each time
    the template is used. Currently, the system supports two variables,
    \_\_BRANCHCODE\_\_ which is replaced with the branchcode of the
    library currently using the template, and \_\_CURRENTDATE\_\_ which
    is replaced with the current date in ISO format ( YYYY-MM-DD ).

You could also use regular expressions to add your library's proxy URL
in front of links in your MARC record.Add proxy URL

-  Choose 'Copy and replace'

-  Decide if you want to copy the first occurance or all occurances of
   the field

-  Enter the field 856 and subfield u to copy

-  Enter the 856 field and u subfield to copy to

-  Check the 'RegEx' box and enter your regular expression (in this case
   s/^/PROXY\_URL/ )

-  Provide a description so you can identify this action later

-  Click 'Add action'

When choosing between 'Copy' and 'Copy and replace' keep the following
example in mind:

::

    245 _aThe art of computer programming _cDonald E. Knuth.
    300 _aA_exists _bB_exists

If we apply action (a) Copy the whole field 245 to 300, we get:

::

    245 _aThe art of computer programming _cDonald E. Knuth.
    300 _aA_exists _bB_exists
    300 _aThe art of computer programming _cDonald E. Knuth.

If we apply action (b) Copy the subfield 245$a to 300$a, we get:

::

    245 _aThe art of computer programming _cDonald E. Knuth.
    300 _aThe art of computer programming _bB_exists

Once your actions are saved you can view them at the top of the screen.
Actions can be moved around using the arrows to the left of them.

View actions
|image341|

Depending on your actions the order may be very important. For example
you don't want to delete a field before you copy it to another field.

To add another template you can either start fresh or click the
'Duplicate current template' checkbox to create a copy of an existing
template to start with.

Duplicate template
|image342|

Once your template is saved you will be able to pick it when using the
`Stage MARC Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__ tool.

Choose template

`Stage MARC Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Stage MARC records for import

This tool can be used to import both bibliographic and authority records
that are saved in MARC format. Importing records into Koha includes two
steps. The first is to stage records for import.

-  First find the MARC file on your computer

   Stage MARC Records for Import
   |image344|

-  Next you will be presented with options for record matching and item
   imports

   Upload options
   |image345|

   -  Enter 'Comments about this file' to identify your upload when
      going to the '`Manage Staged MARC Records <#managestaged>`__' tool

   -  Tell Koha which type of file this is, bibliographic or authority

      Record type
      |image346|

   -  Choose the character encoding

      Chracter encoding
      |image347|

   -  Choose if you would like to use a `MARC Modification
      Template <#marcmodtemplates>`__ to alter the data you're about to
      import

      Choose modification template
      |image348|

   -  Choose whether or not you want to look for matching records

      Look for matches
      |image349|

      -  You can set up `record matching rules <#recordmatchingrules>`__
         through the administration area

         Matching rules
         |image350|

         -  When using the ISBN matching rule Koha will find only exact
            matches. If you find that the ISBN match is not working to
            your satisfaction you can change the
            `AggressiveMatchOnISBN <#AggressiveMatchOnISBN>`__
            preference to 'Do' and then run your import again.

   -  Next choose what to do with matching records if they are found

   -  Finally choose what to do with records that are unique

   -  Next you can choose whether or not to import the item data found
      in the MARC records (if the file you're loading is a bibliographic
      file)

      Import items
      |image351|

      -  From here you can choose to always add items regardless of
         matching status, add them only if a matching bib was found, add
         items only if there was no matching bib record, replace items
         if a matching bib was found (The match will look at the
         itemnumbers and barcodes to match on for items. Itemnumbers
         take precendence over barcodes), or Ignore items and not add
         them.

-  Click 'Stage for import'

-  You will be presented with a confirmation of your MARC import

`Adding Events <#addevents>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before adding events, choose the library you would like to apply the
closings to. When adding events you will be asked if you would like to
apply the event to one branch or all branches. To add events, simply

-  Click on the date on the calendar that you would like to apply the
   closing to

   Calendar Add Form
   |image370|

-  In the form that appears above the calendar, enter the closing
   information (for more info on each option click the question mark [?]
   to the right of the option)

   -  Library will be filled in automatically based on the library you
      chose from the pull down at the top of the page

   -  The day information will also be filled in automatically based on
      the date you clicked on the calendar

   -  In the description enter the reason the library is closed

   -  Next you can choose if this event is a one time event or if it is
      repeatable.

      -  If this is a one day holiday choose 'Holiday only on this day'

      -  If this is a weekly closing (like a weekend day) then you can
         choose 'Holiday repeated every same day of the week'

      -  If this is an annual holiday closing choose 'Holiday repeated
         yearly on the same date'

      -  If the library is going to be closed for the week or a range of
         time choose 'Holiday on a range' and enter a 'To Date' at the
         top

      -  If the library is going to be closed for a range of time each
         year (such as summer holidays for schools) choose 'Holiday
         repeated yearly on a range' and enter a 'To Date' at the top

   -  Finally decide if this event should be applied to all libraries or
      just the one you have originally selected

      -  If you'd rather enter all the holidays and then copy them all
         to another branch all at once you can use the copy menu below
         the calendar

         Copy holidays
         |image371|

   |image373|

-  From this form you can make edits to the holiday or delete the
   holiday completely.

   -  All actions require that you click 'Save' before the change will
      be made.

   Edit repeatable event
   |image374|

   -  In the form above you will note that there is now an option to
      'Generate an exception for this repeated holiday,' choosing this
      option will allow you to make it so that this date is not closed
      even though the library is usually closed on this date.

      -  All actions require that you click 'Save' before the change
         will be made.

`CSV Profiles <#csvprofiles>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Additional Tools > CSV Profiles

CSV Profiles are created to define how you would like your cart or list
to export.

`Add CSV Profiles <#addcsvprofile>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a CSV Profile

-  Click 'CSV Profiles' from the Tools menu

-  The 'Profile type' determines what type of fields you plan to use
   (MARC or SQL) to define your profile

   -  If you choose MARC then you will need to enter MARC fields

   MARC CSV Profile
   |image376|

   -  If you choose SQL then you will need to enter SQL database fields

      SQL CSV Profile
      |image377|

   -  The 'Profile name' will appear on the export pull down list when
      choosing 'Download' from your cart or list

      Download List
      |image378|

   -  The 'Profile description' is for your own benefit, but will also
      appear in the OPAC when patrons download content, so make sure
      it's clear to your patrons as well

   -  The 'CSV separator' is the character used to separate values and
      value groups

          **Note**

          The most common option here is comma because most spreadsheet
          applications know how to open files split by commas.

   -  The 'Field separator' is the character used to separate duplicate
      fields

      -  Example: You may have multiple 650 fields and this is the
         character that will appear in between each one in the column

         Field separators in between multiple subjects
         |image379|

   -  The 'Subfield separator' is the character used to separate
      duplicate subfields

      -  Example: You may have multiple $a subfields in a field

   -  The 'Encoding' field lets you define the encoding used when saving
      the file

   -  Finally format your CSV file using the 'Profile MARC' or 'Profile
      SQL' field

      -  Define which fields or subfields you want to export, separated
         by pipes. Example : 200\|210$a\|301 for MARC and
         biblio.title\|biblio.author for SQL

      -  **Note**

             You can also use your own headers (instead of the ones from
             Koha) by prefixing the field number with an header,
             followed by the equal sign. Example : Personal
             name=100\|title=245$a\|300

   When you have entered in all of the information for you profile,
   simply click 'Submit' and you will be presented with a confirmation
   that your profile has been saved.

have the permission to use it. To find out if the right user has the
permissions necessary, check /etc/at.allow to see what users are in it.
If you don't have that file, check etc/at.deny. If at.deny exists but is
blank, then every user can use it. Talk to your system admin about
adding the user to the right place to make the task scheduler work.

categories <#patcats>`__.

`Add a new patron <#addnewpatron>`__
------------------------------------

Patrons are added by going to the 'Patrons' module.

-  *Get there:* Patrons

Once there you can add a new patron.

-  Click 'New patron'

   Choose patron type
   |image407|

-  The fields that appear on the patron add form can be controlled by
   editing the `BorrowerUnwantedField <#BorrowerUnwantedField>`__ system
   preference.

-  First enter the identifying information regarding your patron

   Add Patron Form
   |image408|

   -  Required fields are defined in the
      `BorrowerMandatoryField <#BorrowerMandatoryField>`__ system
      preference

   -  Salutation is populated by the
      `BorrowersTitles <#BorrowersTitles>`__ system preference

   -  **Note**

          If you'd like to prevent full names from printing on
          `slips <#notices>`__ and you're not using the Initials or
          Other name fields for anything else, you can use them for
          shortened versions of the name to then be printed on the slip.

          For example:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole C.
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: NCE

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>> instead of the full name (NCE).

          Or you could do something like this:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: E

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>>, <<borrowers.firstname>> instead of the
          full name (E, Nicole).

-  Next enter the contact information

   Patron Contact Information
   |image409|

   -  For contact information, note that the primary phone and email
      addresses are the ones that appear on notices and slips printed
      during circulation (receipts, transfer slips and hold slips). The
      primary email is also the one that overdue notices and other
      messages go to.

-  If this patron is a child, you will be asked to attach the child
   patron to an adult patron

   Guarantor Linking
   |image410|

   -  Click 'Set to Patron' to search your system for an existing patron

   -  If the Guarantor is not in the system, you can enter the first and
      last name in the fields available

   -  The relationships are set using the
      `borrowerRelationship <#borrowerRelationship>`__ system preference

-  If this patron is a professional, you will be asked to attach the
   patron to an organizational patron

   Organization Linking
   |image411|

   -  Click 'Set to Patron to search your system for an existing patron

-  Each patron can have an alternate contact

   Alternate Contact
   |image412|

   -  An alternate contact could be a parent or guardian. It can also be
      used in academic settings to store the patron's home address.

-  The library management section includes values that are used within
   the library

   Library Management
   |image413|

   -  The card number field is automatically calculated if you have the
      `autoMemberNum <#autoMemberNum>`__ system preference set that way

      -  **Note**

             For a newly installed system this preference will start at
             1 and increment by 1 each time after. To have it start with
             the starting number of your barcodes, enter the first
             barcode by hand in the patron record and save the patron.
             After that the field will increment that number by 1.

   -  If you accidentally chose the wrong patron category at the
      beginning you can fix that here

   -  Sort 1 and 2 are used for statistical purposes within your library

-  Next, the Library Setup section includes additional library settings

   Library set-up options
   |image414|

   -  The registration date will automatically be filled in with today's
      date

   -  If your patron cards expire (based on your `patron category
      settings <#patcats>`__) the Expiry date will automatically be
      calculated

   -  The OPAC Note is a note for the patron - it will appear in the
      OPAC on the patron's record

   -  The Circulation Note is meant solely for your library staff and
      will appear when the circulation staff goes to check an item out
      to the patron

      Sample Circulation Note
      |image415|

   -  The Staff/OPAC asks for the username and password to be used by
      the patron (and/or staff member) to log into their account in the
      OPAC and for staff to log in to the staff client.

      -  Staff will only be able to use this log in info to log in to
         the staff client if they have the `necessary
         permissions <#patronpermissions>`__.

-  If you have set `additional patron
   attributes <#patronattributetypes>`__ up, these will appear next

   Additional Patron Attributes
   |image416|

-  Finally, if you have
   `EnhancedMessagingPreferences <#EnhancedMessagingPreferences>`__ set
   to 'allow,' you can choose the messaging preferences for this patron.

   Patron Messaging Settings
   |image417|

   -  These notices are:

      -  Advanced notice : A notice in advance of the patron's items
         being due (The patron can choose the number of days in advance)

      -  Item checkout : A notice that lists all the of the items the
         patron has just checked out and/or renewed, this is an
         electronic form of the checkout receipt

      -  Hold filled : A notice when you have confirmed the hold is
         waiting for the patron

      -  Item due : A notice on the day and item is due back at the
         library

      -  Item check-in : A notice that lists all the of the items the
         patron has just checked in

   -  Patrons can choose to receive their notices as a digest by
      checking the 'Digest only?' box along with the delivery method. A
      digest is a combination of all the messages of that type (so all
      items due in 3 days in one email) in to one email instead of
      multiple emails for each alert.

   -  **Important**

          These preferences will override any you set via the `patron
          categories <#addingpatroncat>`__

   -  **Important**

          These preference can be altered by the patron via the OPAC

-  Once finished, click 'Save'

If the system suspects this patron is a duplicate of another it will
warn you.

Patron Duplicate Suspected
|image418|

    **Note**

    A duplicate patron is detected if first and last names match and
    there is no date of birth populated or if first name, last name and
    date of birth fields are all populated. If two patrons have matching
    names, but one has a date of birth and the other does not they will
    not match as duplicates.

If you have set a minimum or upper age limit on the patron category and
are requiring that the birth date be filled in, Koha will warn you if
the patron you're adding is too old or young for the patron category you
have selected:

Patron age warning
|image419|

`Add a Staff Patron <#addstaffpatron>`__
----------------------------------------

All staff members must be entered into Koha as patrons of the 'Staff'
type. Follow the steps in `Add a Patron <#addnewpatron>`__ to add a
staff member. To give the staff member permissions to access the staff
client, follow the steps in `Patron Permissions <#patronpermissions>`__

    **Important**

    Remember to assign your staff secure usernames and passwords since
    these will be used to log into the staff client.

`Add a Statistical Patron <#addstatspatron>`__
----------------------------------------------

One way to track use of in house items is to "check out" the materials
to a statistical patron. The "check out" process doesn’t check the book
out, but instead tracks an in house use of the item. To use this method
for tracking in house use you first will need a `patron
category <#patcats>`__ set up for your Statistical patron.

In House Patron Category
|image420|

Next, you will need to create a new patron of the statistical type

New In House Patron
|image421|

Next, follow the steps put forth in the '`Add a new
Patron <#addnewpatron>`__' section of this manual. Since this patron is
not a real person, simply fill in the required fields, the correct
library and nothing else.

To learn about other methods of tracking in house use visit the
`Tracking inhouse use <#trackinhouse>`__ section of this manual.

`Duplicate a Patron <#duplicatepatron>`__
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes when you're adding a new family to your system you don't want
to type the contact information over and over. Koha allows for you to
duplicate a patron and change only the parts you want to (or need to)
change.

-  Open the patron you want to use as your base (the patron you want to
   duplicate information from)

-  Click the 'Duplicate' button at the top of their record

   The Duplicate Button is the 3rd one in
   |image422|

-  All of the fields with the exception of first name, card number,
   username and password have been duplicated. Fill in the missing
   pieces and click 'Save'

   Duplicating Patron Form
   |image423|

   -  **Note**

          Clicking in a field that is already populated with data will
          clear that field of all information (making it easier for you
          to type in something different)

listing of Circulation functions you can visit the Circulation page
which is linked from the top left of every page or from the center of
the main page.

Before circulating your collection you will want to set your `Global
System Preferences <#globalsysprefs>`__, `Basic
Parameters <#basicparams>`__ and `Patrons & Circulation
Rules <#patscirc>`__.

While in Circulation you can jump between the tabs on the quick search
box at the top of the screen by using the following hot keys:

To check an item out to a patron, first search for that patron using one
of the many options listed above. You will then be presented with the
checkout screen.

Check Out Screen
|image485|

If you have chosen to 'Always show checkouts immediately' then you will
see the list of checkouts below the check out box.

Check Out Screen
|image486|

At the top of the Check Out screen is a box for you to type or scan the
item's barcode into.

-  **Important**

       Many modern barcode scanners will send a 'return' to the browser,
       making it so that the 'Check Out' button is automatically clicked

-  If the barcode is not found you will be prompted to use fast
   cataloging to add the item. Learn more about `fast
   cataloging <#fastaddcat>`__ later in this manual.

-  If you have
   `itemBarcodeFallbackSearch <#itemBarcodeFallbackSearch>`__ set to
   'Enable' then you can enter a keyword search in this box instead of
   just a barcode (this will make it possible to check out using title
   and/or call number).

To see more checkout options click the 'Checkout settings' link to
expand the checkout area.Checkout settings

Below the box for the barcode there may be options for you to override
the default due date for the item.

-  This option will only appear if you have set the
   `SpecifyDueDate <#SpecifyDueDate>`__ system preference to allow staff
   to override the due date

Below the box for the barcode you will see a checkbox for 'Automatic
renewal'. This will allow this item to automatically renew if the
`appropriate cron job <#autorenewcron>`__ is running and there are no
holds on the item.

Next is an option to no decrease the loan length based on holds. This
overrides the `decreaseLoanHighHolds <#decreaseLoanHighHolds>`__
preference.

If you're allowing the `checkout of items on site <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__
to patrons (these are usually items that are not for loan that you would
like to check for in library use) then you will see the 'On-site
checkout' checkbox after clicking the 'Checkout settings' link to expand
your circulation options.On-site checkout

At the bottom of the page there is a summary of the patron's current
checked out items along with the due date (and time if the item is an
hourly loan), items checked out today will appear at the top.

    **Note**

    Items that are hourly loan items will include the time with the due
    date.

Patron's checkout summary
|image487|

If you checked out an item for on site use you will see that highlighted
in red in the checkout summary.

Patron's on-site checkout
|image488|

If you have set your `ExportWithCsvProfile <#ExportWithCsvProfile>`__
preference, you will also see the option to export the patron's current
checkout information using a CSV Profile or ISO2709 (MARC21) format.

Export patron's checkout information
|image489|

Also at the bottom of the page is the list of items the patron has on
hold

Holds summary on check out screen
|image490|

From the holds list you can suspend or resume patrons holds using the
options at the bottom of the list if you have the
`SuspendHoldsIntranet <#SuspendHoldsIntranet>`__ preference set to
'allow.'

    **Note**

    If you have your
    `AutoResumeSuspendedHolds <#AutoResumeSuspendedHolds>`__ preference
    set to "Don't allow" then you will not have the option to put an end
    date on the hold suspension

If there are notes on the patron record these will appear to the right
of the checkout box

`Printing Receipts <#printcircreceipt>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have checked out all of the items for the patron you can print
them a receipt by choosing one of two methods.

If you have the `CircAutoPrintQuickSlip <#CircAutoPrintQuickSlip>`__
preference set to 'open a print quick slip window' you can simply hit
enter on your keyboard or scan a blank piece of paper with your barcode
scanner. The idea being that you're "checking out" a blank barcode which
triggers Koha to print the 'Quick slip.'

You can also click the Print button at the top of the screen and choose
'Print slip' or 'Print quick slip'.

Print receipt to slip printer
|image494|

If you choose 'Print slip' it will print all of the items the patron has
checked out, including those they checked out at an earlier date.
Choosing 'Print quick slip' will print only the items that were checked
out today.

'Print summary' will generate a full page summary for the patron's
circulation information and 'Print overdues' will print out a slip that
lists all items that are overdue.

What prints on the slips can be customized by altering the slip
templates under the `Notices & Slips <#notices>`__ tool.

`Clear Patron Information <#clearpatroninfo>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you're done checking an item out if you have the
`DisplayClearScreenButton <#DisplayClearScreenButton>`__ preference set
to 'Show' you can clear the current patron by clicking the X in the top
right of the patron's info to remove the current patron from the screen
and start over.

Clear Screen Button
|image495|

If you have the `CircAutoPrintQuickSlip <#CircAutoPrintQuickSlip>`__
preference set to 'clear the screen' then you simply need to hit enter
or scan a blank barcode and the screen will be cleared of the current
patron.

`Batch Checkouts <#batchcheckout>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to perform a batch check out you can do so by turning
on the `BatchCheckouts <#BatchCheckouts>`__ system preference and
assigning the proper patron categories via the
`BatchCheckoutsValidCategories <#BatchCheckoutsValidCategories>`__
preference. This will allow you to use an RFID pad that reads multiple
barcodes or perform a batch check out for training internal use.Batch
checkouts

From this screen you can scan several barcodes or load a file of
barcodes. If those items cannot be checked out they will provide a
warning on the following screen

Batch checkout warnings
|image496|

If you are using a statistical patron type then you'll see that local
use was recorded for each item you scanned.

Batch local use
|image497|

`Check Out Messages <#checkoutmsg>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you check out an item that has multiple pieces and you have cataloged
that information in subfield 3 of the item record (in MARC21) a message
will pop up when you check out that item telling you how many pieces
should be there.

Materials in the checked out item
|image498|

There are times when Koha will prevent the librarian from being able to
check out items to a patron. When this happens a warning will appear
notifying the librarian of why the patron cannot check items out.

-  Patron owes too much in fines

`Renewing <#circrenew>`__
-------------------------

Checked out items can be renewed (checked out for another period of
time) based on your `circulation rules <#circfinerules>`__ and `renewal
preferences <#RenewalPeriodBase>`__.

If `you allow it <#OpacRenewalAllowed>`__, patrons can renew their own
items via the OPAC, but sometimes you'll need to help them by renewing
their items via the staff client.

To renew items checked out to a patron, you can do one of two things.

The first is to visit their details page or checkout page and review
their checkout summary at the bottom.

Circulation Summary
|image518|

In the Renew column you will see how many times each item has been
renewed and a checkbox to renew the item for the patron. Check the boxed
of the items you would like to renew and click the 'Renew or Return
checked items' button, or to renew all items checked out to the patron
simply click the 'Renew all' button.

Renew buttons
|image519|

Sometimes renewals will be blocked based on your circulation rules, to
override this block you must have your
`AllowRenewalLimitOverride <#AllowRenewalLimitOverride>`__ preference
set to 'Allow'. If you allow renewal limit overrides, you will see a
checkbox at the bottom left of the circulation summary. Check that box
and then choose the items you would like to renew.

Override renewal limit
|image520|

Checking that box will add checkboxes in the renew column above where
before the item was not renewable.

The second option is to visit the 'Renew' page found under the
Circulation menu.

Renew
|image521|

And scan the barcodes of the items you would like to renew.

If you are checking items in that were put in the book drop while the
library was closed you can check the 'Book drop mode' box before
scanning items. This will effectively roll back the returned date to the
last date the library was open.

-  This requires that you have your closings added to the `Holidays &
   Calendar Tool <#calholidays>`__

You can also choose to forgive all overdue charges for items you are
checking in by checking the 'Forgive overdue charges' box before
scanning items.

-  If you are checking an item in at a library other than the home
   branch, a message will appear asking you to transfer the book to the
   home library

   pieces a message will appear warning you about the number of pieces
   you should have in your hand

      with the patron's information

   -  Ignoring the hold will leave the item on hold, but leave its
      status as Available (it will not cancel the hold)

-  If you have the system showing you fines at the time of checkin
   (`FineNotifyAtCheckin <#FineNotifyAtCheckin>`__) you will see a

Circulation messages meant for the patron will also appear when they log
into the OPAC.

`Holds <#holds>`__
------------------

Koha allows patrons to put things on hold. A 'Hold' is a way to reserve
an item. Depending on your `circulation and fine
rules <#circfinerules>`__ and `hold preference <#circholdspolicy>`__
settings patrons will be able to place items on hold for pickup at the
library at a later date/time.

`Placing Holds in Staff Client <#holdsinstaff>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to place holds from the staff client. The most
obvious is using the 'Place Hold' button at the top of any bibliographic
record.

Place Hold Button on Bib Record
|image545|

You can also click the smaller 'Place Hold' link found at the top of
your catalog search results, or the 'Holds' link found below each
result.

Hold options on search results
|image546|

You will be asked to search for a patron by barcode or any part of their
name to start the hold process.

Find Patron For Hold
|image547|

If you'd like to search for the patron first and then the bib record for
the hold, you can open the patron record and click on the 'Search to
Hold' button at the top of the patron record.

Search to Hold on Patron Record
|image548|

After clicking the button you will be brought to the catalog search page
where you can find the book(s) you want to place a hold on. Under each
title on the results you'll see an option to 'Hold for Patron Name.'

Hold for Patron links on Search Results
|image549|

If you want to place a hold on multiple items, simply check the boxes to
the left of them and click the arrow to the right of the 'Place Hold'
button.

Hold Multiple Items for Patron
|image550|

Depending on how many items you choose to place a hold on at once you
will see a different place hold form. If you are placing a hold on one
bibliographic record you will see a list of all of the items you can
place a hold on.

Place Hold Form
|image551|

-  Enter any notes that might apply to this hold

-  Choose the library where the patron will pick up the item

-  If you have the
   `AllowHoldItemTypeSelection <#AllowHoldItemTypeSelection>`__
   preference set to 'Allow' and the record had more than one item type
   attached you will see an option to choose to limit the hold to a
   specific item typeAllowHoldItemTypeSelection

-  If the patron wants the hold to start on a date other than today,
   enter that in the 'Hold starts on date' field

   -  This option will only appear if the
      `AllowHoldDateInFuture <#AllowHoldDateInFuture>`__ system
      preference is set to 'Allow'

-  If the patron has specified that they don't want the item after a
   certain date, or if you have limits on hold lengths, you can enter an
   expiration date for the hold in the 'Hold expires on date'

   -  To have expired holds canceled automatically you will need to have
      the `Expired Holds <#expiredholdscron>`__ cron job set to run on a
      regular basis.

-  Next choose if you want to place a hold on the next available item or
   a specific item by clicking the radio button next to an individual
   item.

If you're placing a hold on multiple items you will be presented with
the next available option for all titles. If no items are available for
hold it will say so on the confirmation screen.

Place multiple items on hold
|image552|

Once your hold is placed, if you'd like to have Koha forget that you
used the 'Search to Hold' function, you can choose to have Koha 'forget'
the patron's name by clicking the arrow to the right of the 'Place Hold'
button on the search results and choosing the 'Forget' option.

Forget Search to Hold Option
|image553|

`Managing Holds <#manageholds>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Holds can be altered and canceled from the Holds tab found on the left
of the bibliographic record.

Bibliographic Record Tabs
|image554|

From the list of holds you can change the order of the holds, the pickup
location, suspend and/or cancel the hold.

Lists of Holds
|image555|

    **Note**

    If you have your
    `AutoResumeSuspendedHolds <#AutoResumeSuspendedHolds>`__ preference
    set to "Don't allow" then you will not have the option to put an end
    date on the hold suspension

    **Note**

    Depending on how you have your `HidePatronName <#HidePatronName>`__
    system preference set the list may show card numbers instead of
    names in the Patron column like in the image above.

To rearrange or delete holds, simply make a selection from the
'Priority' pull down or click the arrows to the right of the priority
pull down.

Hold Priority Menu
|image556|

If you use the priority pull down to rearrange or delete holds you will
need to click the 'Update hold(s)' button to save your changes.

Clicking the down arrow to the right of the hold will stick the hold at
the bottom of the list even if more requests are made.

For example, your library has home-bound patrons that are allowed to
keep books out for months at a time. It would not be fair to other
patrons if a home-bound patron were able to check out a brand new book
and keep it for months. For this reason, the home-bound patron's hold
request would stay at the bottom of the queue until everyone else who
wanted to read that book has already done so.

Lowest Priority & Delete Options for Holds
|image557|

If a patron asks to have their hold suspended and you have the
`SuspendHoldsIntranet <#SuspendHoldsIntranet>`__ system preference set
to 'allow' you can do so by clicking the Suspend button to far right. If
the patron gives you a date for the items to become unsuspended you can
enter that in the date box and click the 'Update hold(s)' button to save
your changes.

Hold suspension column
|image558|

To delete or cancel a hold click the red 'X' to the right of the hold
line. To delete/cancel a bunch of holds you can choose 'del' from pull
down to the left of each line and then click 'Update hold(s)' at the
bottom of the list.

Cancel Holds
|image559|

`Receiving Holds <#receiveholds>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When items that are on hold are `checked in <#checkingin>`__ or
`out <#checkingout>`__ the system will remind the circulation librarian
that the item is on hold and offer them options for managing the hold.

When you check in an item that has a hold on it the system will ask you
to either confirm and transfer the item

Confirm Hold & Transfer
|image560|

or just confirm the hold

Confirm Hold
|image561|

Clicking the Confirm button will mark the item as on hold for the
patron. If the item needs to be transferred the item will also be marked
as in transit to the proper branch. Clicking 'Ignore' will retain the
hold, but allow you to check the item out to another patron. Choosing to
confirm and print will present you with a printable page that you can
slip inside the book with the necessary hold and/or transfer
information.

Once confirmed the hold will show on the patron record and on the
checkout screen under the 'Hold' tab.

Hold on Patron Record
|image562|

From here if the patron would like you suspend their holds you can do so
one by one or in bulk.

The item record will also show that the item is on hold.

Hold on Item Record
|image563|

In some cases a patron may come in to pick up a hold for their partner
(or someone else in their household). In this case you want to make sure
that the hold is cancelled when you check the item out to someone else.
When trying to check out an item that is already waiting for someone
else you will be presented with a warning message.

Hold waiting for someone else
|image564|

From here you can check the item out to the patron at the desk and
cancel the hold for the patron.

`Transfers <#transfers>`__
--------------------------

If you work in a multi-branch system you can transfer items from one
library to another by using the Transfer tool.

-  *Get there*: Circulation > Transfer

To transfer an item

-  Click 'Transfer' on the Circulation page

   Transfer Tool
   |image565|

   -  Enter the library you would like to transfer the item to

   -  Scan or type the barcode on the item you would like to transfer

-  Click 'Submit'

   Transfer Summary
   |image566|

-  The item will now say that it is in transit

   Item in Transit
   |image567|

-  When the item arrives at the other branch the librarian must check
   the item in to acknowledge that it is no longer in transit

-  The item will not be permanently moved to the new library

   Item record
   |image568|

   -  The item shows the same 'Home Library' but has updated the
      'Current Location' to note where it resides at this time

`Set Library <#setlibrary>`__
-----------------------------

By default you will enter the staff client as if you are at your home
library. This library will appear in the top right of the Staff Client.

My Library
|image569|

This is the library that all circulation transactions will take place
at. If you are at another library (or on a bookmobile) you will want to
set your library before you start circulating items. To do this you can
click 'Set' at the top right or on the Circulation page.

Set Library Form
|image570|

Once you have saved your changes you new library will appear in the top
right.

`Fast Add Cataloging <#fastaddcat>`__
-------------------------------------

Sometimes circulation librarians need to quickly add a record to the
system for an item they are about to check out. This is called 'Fast
Add.' To allow circulation librarians access to the Fast Add Cataloging
tool, simply make sure they have the
`fast\_cataloging <#fastaddpermissions>`__ permissions. There are two
ways to add titles via fast add. If you know that you're about to check
out an item that isn't in you catalog you can go to the Circulation
module and click 'Fast cataloging.'

Circulation Menu
|image571|

The cataloging interface will open up with the short cataloging record:

Fast Add Framework
|image572|

After adding your cataloging data you will be asked to enter item data.
Enter the items barcode, collection code, etc and save the item before
checking it out.

The other way to fast catalog is from the checkout screen. When you
enter a barcode at checkout that Koha can't find, it will prompt you to
use fast cataloging to add the item to Koha and check it out.

Barcode not found
|image573|

Clicking 'Fast cataloging' will bring you to the fast cataloging form
where you can enter the title information

Fast cataloging
|image574|

After clicking 'Save' you will be brought to the item record where the
barcode will already be filled in with the barcode you're trying to
check out.

Fast cataloging item record
|image575|

After clicking the 'Add item' button the item will automatically be
checked out the patron you were trying to check the book out to
originally.

Checked out item
|image576|

`Circulation Reports <#circreports>`__
--------------------------------------

Most reports can be found via the Reports module, but some of the more
common circulation reports are available right from the Circulation
module.

-  *Get there*: Circulation > Circulation reports

`Holds Queue <#holdsqueue>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you all of the holds at your library.

Sample Holds Queue
|image577|

To generate this report, you must have the `Build Holds Queue cron
job <#buildholdscron>`__ running. This cron job is a script that should
be run periodically if your library system allows borrowers to place
on-shelf holds. This script decides which library should be responsible
for fulfilling a given hold request.

It's behavior is controlled by the system preferences
`StaticHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__ and
`RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__.

If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the on-shelf
holds fulfillment process, you should list the libraries that \*do\*
participate in the process here by inputting all the participating
library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g. "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc.
).

By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system will
first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the pickup
library if possible. If there are no items available at the pickup
library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use the list of
libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled ( which it is by default ), the
script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
small, medium and large ) and you want the burden of holds fulfillment
to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you would want
StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like "LRG,MED,SML".

If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
throughout your library system, simply enable RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight.
When this system preference is enabled, the order in which libraries
will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf hold will be randomized each
time the list is regenerated.

Leaving StaticHoldsQueueWeight empty is contraindicated at this time.
Doing so will cause the build\_holds\_queue script to ignore
RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight, causing the script to request hold
fulfillment not randomly, but by alphabetical order.

`Holds to pull <#holdspull>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you all of the items that have holds on them that
are available at the library for pulling. If the items are available at
multiple branches then all branches with that item available will see
the hold to pull until one library triggers the hold.

Holds to Pull
|image578|

You can limit the results you see by using the Refine box on the left
side of the page:

Refine Holds to Pull Report
|image579|

`Holds awaiting pickup <#holdspickup>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show all of the holds that are waiting for patrons to
pick them up.

Holds Awaiting Pickup
|image580|

Items that have been on the hold shelf longer than you normally allow
(based on the `ReservesMaxPickUpDelay <#ReservesMaxPickUpDelay>`__
preference value) will appear on the 'Holds Over' tab, they will not
automatically be cancelled unless you have set the `cron
job <#expiredholdscron>`__ to do that for you, but you can cancel all
holds using the button at the top of the list.

Items waiting on the hold shelf too long
|image581|

`Hold ratios <#holdratios>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hold ratios help with collection development. Using this report you will
be able to see how many of your patrons have holds on items and whether
you should buy more. By default it will be set to the library needing 3
items per hold that has been placed. The report will tell you how many
additional items need to be purchased to meet this quota.

Hold Ratios
|image582|

`Transfers to receive <#transferstoreceive>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will list all of the items that Koha thinks are in transit
to your library.

Transfers to Receive
|image583|

If your transfers are late in arriving at your library you will see a
message stating how late your items are.

Late transfers include warning messages
|image584|

    **Important**

    An item is considered late based on the number of days you have
    entered in the
    `TransfersMaxDaysWarning <#TransfersMaxDaysWarning>`__ system
    preference.

`Overdues <#overduesreport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Important**

    For libraries with a large patron base, this report may take a
    significant amount of time to run.

    **Note**

    Large libraries can choose to filter the report before it runs by
    setting the
    `FilterBeforeOverdueReport <#FilterBeforeOverdueReport>`__ system
    preference to 'Require'.

This report will list all items that are overdue at your library.

Overdues List
|image585|

The report can be filtered using the menu options found on the left of
the report.

    **Note**

    The 'Show any items currently checked out' checkbox basically
    switches this from a report of overdues to a report of checkouts. It
    will show all titles checked out regardless of due date.

`Overdues with fines <#overduesfines>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you any overdues at your library that have accrued
fines on them.

Overdues with fines
|image586|

If you would like to limit the report you can use the pull down menu at
the top to limit to a specific shelving location at your branch. To see
overdues with fines at other branches you will have to `change your
branch <#setlibrary>`__ or log in at that branch.

    **Important**

    If you do not charge fines and/or don't have the `fines cron
    job <#finescronjob>`__ running you will see no data on this report.

`Pending on-site checkouts <#pendingonsite>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the on site checkouts functionality
(`OnSiteCheckouts <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__) then you'll have a report to
view all items that are currently checked out on site.Pending onsite
checkouts

This will list the due date (overdues in red), who has the item, item
information and what library the item is at.

`Tracking In house Use <#trackinhouse>`__
-----------------------------------------

Many libraries track the use of items within the library.

    **Note**

    This is different from tracking on site usage. In house use is the
    use of items in the library by patrons without them having to check
    them out. On site use is the use of items on site that must first be
    checked out. To learn more about on site usage please review the
    `OnSiteCheckouts <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__ preference.

Tracking the use of items in the library without checking them out can
be done in Koha one of two ways. The first is to create one or more
`Statistical Patrons <#addstatspatron>`__. When collecting items that
have been used within the library, you will want to check them out to
your statistical patron:

Check Out Items to Stats Patron
|image587|

Instead of marking the item as 'checked out' the system will record that
the item was used in house:

Local Use Recorded
|image588|

Repeat these steps for all items that have been used within the library
to keep accurate statistics for item use.

The other way to record local use of items is to set your
`RecordLocalUseOnReturn <#RecordLocalUseOnReturn>`__ preference to
'Record.' Then whenever you check an item in that is not checked out and
not on hold a local use will be recorded.

Local Use Recorded
|image589|

    **Note**

    If you have `RecordLocalUseOnReturn <#RecordLocalUseOnReturn>`__ set
    to 'Record' you can still use your statistical patrons to record
    local use as well.

`In Processing / Book Cart Locations <#processinglocations>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------

Koha allows for handling temporary locations like the processing center
and/or book carts throughout the library. For this feature to work you
must first make sure you have `authorized values <#authorizedvalues>`__
set in the `LOC <#shelvelocvals>`__ category for PROC (Processing
Center) and CART (Book Cart).

CART & PROC values in LOC
|image590|

Next you need to set the
`NewItemsDefaultLocation <#NewItemsDefaultLocation>`__ system preference
to PROC. This will set the new items to the Processing Center as their
default location.

When creating items you enter in their desired final shelving location
and Koha will temporarily change that to PROC. If
`InProcessingToShelvingCart <#InProcessingToShelvingCart>`__ is set to
"Don't move" then when an item with a location of PROC is checked in it
will either automatically update the item to use the permanent location.
If `InProcessingToShelvingCart <#InProcessingToShelvingCart>`__ is set
to "Move" then when an item is checked in the location is changed from
PROC to CART.

A `cron job <#proccartcron>`__ is then set to run at specified intervals
to age items from CART to the permanent shelving location. (For example,
an hourly cron entry of cart\_to\_shelf.pl --hours 3 where --hours is
the amount of time an item should spend on the cart before aging to its
permanent location.)

-  **Note**

       If the `ReturnToShelvingCart <#ReturnToShelvingCart>`__ system
       preference is set to "Move", any newly checked-in item is also
       automatically put into the shelving cart, to be covered by the
       same script run.

-  **Important**

       Checkins with confirmed holds will not go into the shelving cart.
       If items on the shelving cart are checked out, the cart location
       will be cleared.

`Self Checkout <#selfcheckout>`__
---------------------------------

Koha comes with a very basic self checkout module. To enable this module
you need to set the `WebBasedSelfCheck <#WebBasedSelfCheck>`__
preference to 'Enable.' To use this module you have to log in as a
`staff member <#addstaffpatron>`__ with `circulation
permissions <#patronpermissions>`__.

    **Note**

    Create a `staff patron <#addstaffpatron>`__ specifically for this
    action so that you don't leave a real staff client logged into a
    computer all day

There is no link to the Self Checkout module, but a simple addition to
the `IntranetUserJS <#intranetuserjs>`__ system preference can add one.

::

    $(document).ready(function(){ $("#login
          #submit").parent().after("<p><a
          href=\"http://YOUR_KOHA_OPAC_URL/cgi-bin/koha/sco/sco-main.pl\"
          target=\"_blank\">Self-Checkout</a></p>"); });

    **Important**

    The code above has line breaks added to make it more readable,
    please be sure to enter the above as one line in when putting it in
    the system preference.

The link will then appear at the bottom of the log in page:

Self Checkout Link on Staff Login
|image591|

You can also access this module by going to :
http://YOUR\_KOHA\_OPAC\_URL/cgi-bin/koha/sco/sco-main.pl

When on the self checkout page depending on your value in the
`SelfCheckoutByLogin <#SelfCheckoutByLogin>`__ preference you will be
asked to enter you cardnumber

Self Checkout Patron Card Number
|image592|

or your username and password:

Shelf checkout by login
|image593|

Once you're logged in to the self check module you will be asked to scan
the items you are checking out

Self Checkout
|image594|

As you scan items they will appear below the barcode box

Self Checkout Summary
|image595|

When you are finished scanning items it is important to click the
'Finish' button. This will prompt you to print a receipt and log you out
of the self check module.

Self Checkout Receipt
|image596|

When attempting to check items out there are some instances where error
messages will appear and the patron will be directed to the librarian.
This will happen even if you are allowing overrides on circulation
functions. Only a librarian can override a circulation block and so
patrons must go to the librarian for help in these situations.

Self Checkout Error Message
|image597|

`Offline Circulation Utilities <#offlinecirc>`__
------------------------------------------------

Koha allows for you to continue circulation actions while offline by
using any one of three utilities.

`Offline Circulation in Koha <#kohaofflinecirc>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the `AllowOfflineCirculation <#AllowOfflineCirculation>`__ preference
is set to 'Enable' the library staff can continue to perform circulation
actions within Koha when the system is offline. You will want to visit
http://your-koha-staff-client-url/cgi-bin/koha/circ/offline.pl at least
once while online and bookmark that page. That is the page you will go
to when you are offline.

    **Important**

    The offline interface uses HTML LocalStorage, which depending on the
    browser and user setting, is limited to 2.5MB or 5MB per domain.
    This means that larger systems will not be able to synchronize their
    data and are recommended to use either the
    `Firefox <#firefoxofflinecirc>`__ or
    `Windows <#windowsofflinecirc>`__ application for offline
    circulation.

`Setup <#kohaofflinesetup>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the first time the system goes offline go to Circulation and
choose 'Built-in offline circulation interface'

Built-in offline circulation interface
|image598|

And synchronize your data on every circulation computer by clicking the
'Synchronize' link on the right of the screen.

Synchronize data
|image599|

    **Important**

    The offline interface uses HTML LocalStorage, which depending on the
    browser and user setting, is limited to 2.5MB or 5MB per domain.
    This means that larger systems will not be able to synchronize their
    data and are recommended to use either the
    `Firefox <#firefoxofflinecirc>`__ or
    `Windows <#windowsofflinecirc>`__ application for offline
    circulation.

This will allow you download a local copy of your patrons and
circulation data. Click the 'Download records' link at the top of the
page to synchronize your data.

Download records for offline use
|image600|

Once your data is downloaded you will see the dates your data was last
synced to the right of each data set.Synced offline dataThis should be
done regularly in preparation for any unexpected connection losses.

`Circulating <#kohaofflinecirculating>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When your system goes offline visit the Offline Circulation page
(http://your-koha-staff-client-url/cgi-bin/koha/circ/offline.pl) in Koha
and click 'Check out' or 'Check in' to perform offline actions.

Checking out is done by searching for the patron by barcode or name at
the top of the 'Check out' screen. After selecting a patron you will be
presented with the synced patron info, including fines and check outs.

Check out offline
|image601|

Scan the barcode of the item you would like to check out and enter a due
date. If you don't enter a due date Koha will prompt you for one.

Offline due date
|image602|

Once the item is checked out it will appear below the patron's info.

`Koha Offline Uploading <#kohaofflineupload>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the system is back online visit the Synchronize page on the Offline
Circulation module and click 'Upload transactions'

Upload transactions
|image604|

After the files are uploaded you can click 'View pending offline
circulation actions' on the right.

View pending offline circulation actions
|image605|

After clicking 'View pending offline circulation actions' you will be
brought to a summary of all of the actions you loaded in to Koha in your
\*.koc file.

|image606|

-  Once all of the logs from all of the circulation computers are loaded
   you will be able to check them all or select just those you want to
   process into Koha.

-  Click on the Process button and Koha will record every stored
   transaction one by one. For each transaction, the status will change
   to:

   -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

   -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

   -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

   -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

Once finished you will have a summary of all of your transactions

`Firefox Plugin <#firefoxofflinecirc>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an offline circulation tool that you can add to your Firefox
browser as an addon. To do so, just go to
https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/koct/ page and click on the
"install now" button. You may have to confirm the installation, just
click on "install now" and then restart Firefox to complete the
installation.

Once you have installed the plugins and restarted Firefox, you will see
the Koha logo in the download bar at the bottom right of Firefox.

Koha Icon on Add-on Bar
|image608|

A click on the logo will open the tool in its own window.

Koha Offline Circ Tool
|image609|

The plugin consists of four tabs:

-  The Check Out tab is where you check out items

-  The Check In tab is where you check in items

-  The Log tab keeps track of every transaction done while in offline
   mode

   -  The log will keep information until you empty it. Each time you
      open the plugin and it contains data in the log it will warn you

      Koha Offline Circ Warning
      |image610|

      If you'd like to clear the log, check the 'I want to delete rows'
      box before hitting the 'OK' button. Otherwise clicking 'OK' will
      keep the items in the log and let you continue working with the
      tool.

-  The Param tab is to set up the plugin

The first thing you want to do then is to set up the plugin. Go to the
Param tab to set up the plugin

Koha Offline CIrc Params
|image611|

Answer the 4 questions presented:

-  Server = the URL of the librarian interface

-  Branch Code = the code for the branch where you are located

-  Username = your staff account login

-  Password = your staff account password

    **Important**

    To save the settings, you will have to close the plugin window and
    re-open it by clicking again on the Koha logo in the add-on bar.

    **Note**

    You can create a staff account dedicated to the offline circulation.
    So that, no matter who is at the circulation desk, they can all use
    the same login. Along those lines, you can use a group login that
    you already have in place for circulation as well.

Once you have everything set up you can start checking items in and out.

Checking out:

Koha Offline Circulation Check Out
|image612|

-  Go to the Check Out tab

-  Scan the patron barcode

-  Scan the item barcode

-  Click 'Save'

Checking in:

Koha Offline Circulation Check In
|image613|

-  Go to the Check In tab

-  Scan the item barcode

-  Click Save

Each time, you check out or check in an item, a new transaction is
recorded in the local plugin database and you will see, at the bottom of
the plugin how many transactions has been made during the offline
circulation. For example, "10 Row(s) Added" means you did 10
transactions.

Koha Offline Circulation Tool Count
|image614|

Then, if you want an overview of every transaction, go to the Log tab.
This tab will show you the transactions in the plugin database

Koha Offline Circulation Log
|image615|

    **Note**

    The status will be "Local." as long as you are offline and don't
    process the transactions into Koha.

When your Internet connection comes back up you will want to get these
transactions in to Koha. Before processing these transactions you should
be aware of a few issues.

Because you are not connected to your Koha database when using this
plugin holds will need additional processing. If an item you check in
while offline has a hold, the hold is kept on the item. Since, you can't
confirm holds found during the processing of every check in, the holds
stay on the item and will need to be managed later. If you only checked
in a few items you can just keep a record of them all. If you checked in
a lot of items you can use the Holds Queue once it rebuilds to see what
holds made it to the shelf erroneously.

Similarly, if an patron card was expired, the offline circulation tool
won't know about it, so the checkout will be recorded regardless of the
patron's account being blocked normally.

You have two options for adding this data to Koha

-  Commit to Koha

   -  If you checked in/out on more than one computer at the same time,
      what you want is to process every transaction consistently. Let's
      say for instance that one patron checked a book out on one
      computer and then checked the same book in on another computer. To
      be consistent, you need to record the check out first and then the
      check in. Not the opposite! To do so, you need to group every
      transaction in one place, sort them all and then, process
      everything. So, you need to use the "Commit to Koha" option from
      every plugin/computer you worked with. This way, the log will go
      to Koha and be accessible from the Offline Circulation page.

      Circulation Menu
      |image616|

   -  *Get there:* Circulation > Pending offline circulation actions

      Offline Circulation
      |image617|

   -  Once all of the logs from all of the circulation computers are
      loaded you will be able to check them all or select just those you
      want to process into Koha.

   -  Click on the Process button and Koha will record every stored
      transaction one by one. For each transaction, the status will
      change to:

      -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

      -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

      -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

      -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

   -  Once finished you will have a summary of all of your transactions

      Offline Circulation Summary
      |image618|

-  Apply directly

   -  If you performed all of the circulation actions on one computer
      then everything is sorted already so you can choose to "Apply
      directly"

   -  The status column will be updated to let you know if the
      transactions were applied

      -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

      -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

      -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

      -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

   -  Once you're finished you can review all of the items right in the
      Log tab

      Koha Offline Circulation Apply Directly

Once you are done you can clear the log by clicking Clear. If you don't
you will be warned the next time you open the Offline Circulation tool.

Cataloging
==========

Before you start cataloging in Koha you're going to want to do some
basic setup. Refer to the `Implementation Checklist <#implementation>`__
for a full list of these things. Most importantly you're going to want
to make sure that your `Frameworks <#marcbibframeworks>`__ are all
defined the way you want. Once in the cataloging module you will not be
able to add or remove fields and subfields so your frameworks must be
ready before you start cataloging.

You can also use OCLC Connexion to send records directly in to Koha. For
more information on that please review the `OCLC Connexion Setup
appendix <#oclcappendix>`__.

-  *Get there:* More > Cataloging

`Bibliographic Records <#catbibs>`__
------------------------------------

In Koha the bibliographic record contains the main information related
to the material. This includes things like the title, author, ISBN, etc.
This information is stored in Koha in Marc (different flavors of Marc
are supported in Koha). Once this information is saved, `items or
holdings <#catitems>`__ can be attached.

`Adding Records <#addbibrec>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Records can be added to Koha via original or copy cataloging. You can
also choose to use the basic or advanced cataloging interface for all of
your work.

If you would like to catalog a record using a blank template in the
basic editor

   to edit & make your changes.

-  Your work will automatically be saved, and when finished you can
   select the "x" to close the window, or select a macro to run on the
   record that you're editing, or select another macro to run.

The basic syntax of the macro language:

-  new 500=‡aEdited with Rancor

   -  Creates a new 500 with a ‡a subfield and sets it to "Edited with
      Rancor".

-  245c= by J.K. Rowling.

   -  Sets the first ‡c subfield of the first 245 tag in the record to "
      by J.K. Rowling", creating it if necessary.

-  082a={084a}

   -  Sets the ‡a subfield of the first 082 tag (creating the subfield
      if necessary) to the contents of the first 084‡a.

-  indicators=\_1

   -  Sets the indicators of the last mentioned tag (in this case, 082)
      to "\_" and "1".

-  new 090a=Z674.75.W67

   -  Creates a new ‡a subfield on the first 090 (but only if that field
      already exists) and sets it to Z674.75.W67.

-  new 090a at end=Z674.75.W67

   -  Same as above.

-  new 245b after a= a tale of might and magic /

   -  Creates a new ‡b after the first a subfield and sets it to " a
      tale of might and magic /".

-  delete 245b

   -  Deletes the first ‡b subfield on the first 245 to ‡b

`Adding Analytic Records <#cataloganalytics>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries sometimes make journal articles and articles within monographs
and serials accessible to library patrons through analytics cataloging.
Analytics cataloging creates separate bibliographic records for these
articles, chapters, sections, etc. found within a larger resource such
as a book, an article within a journal, newspaper or serial. In
analytics cataloging, although a separate bib record is created for the
title, it is not physically separated from the host item.  Learn more
about Analytics in Chapter 13 of AACR2.

If you would like to catalog analytic records there are two options. One
is to use the `Easy Analytics <#catalogeasyanalytics>`__ funtion; the
other is the `Analytics Enhanced Workflow <#catalogenhanceanalytics>`__.

`Easy Analytics <#catalogeasyanalytics>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Easy Analytics feature makes linking analytic records together
easier. The first thing you need to do is set the
`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ preference to
'Display' and the `UseControlNumber <#UseControlNumber>`__ preference to
'Don't use.'

After cataloging your analytic record (see `Adding
Records <#addbibrec>`__ for more on creating records) click 'Edit' from
the normal view and choose to 'Link to Host Item'

Link to Host Item
|image646|

This will prompt you to enter the barcode for the item this record
should be linked to.

Barcode for Analytic Linking
|image647|

After entering the item's barcode and clicking 'Select' you will receive
a confirmation message.

Analytic Link Success
|image648|

The record will now have the 773 field filled in properly to complete
the link.

773
|image649|

To view all of the items tied to the host record, do a search for the
record, click the Analytics tab on the left and the analytics tied to
each barcode will be shown under the "Used in" column.

Analytics Tab
|image650|

    **Note**

    It is also possible to create analytic records from this screen by
    clicking on "Create Analytics"

You can also see the analytics attached to this record by clicking the
'Show Analytic' link towards the top of the record in the normal view.

Show Analytics on Bib Record
|image651|

When looking at the anaytic record you will also see a link to the host
item under the 'Host records' column in the holdings table when viewing
the 'Analtyics' tab.

Host Record
|image652|

`Analytics Enhanced Workflow <#catalogenhanceanalytics>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the Enhanced Workflow method of adding analytics, the first thing
you need to do is set the
`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ preference to 'Don't
display' and the `UseControlNumber <#UseControlNumber>`__ preference to
'Use.'

After cataloging your original record (see `Adding
Records <#addbibrec>`__ for more on creating records) click 'New' from
the normal view and choose to 'New child record.'

New child record
|image653|

This will open a new blank record for cataloging. The blank record will
only have the 773 field filled in properly to complete the link once the
record is saved.

|image654|

To view all of the items tied to the host record, do a search for the
record, click the Analytics tab on the left and the analytics tied to
each barcode will be shown under the "Used in" column.

|image656|

When looking at the anaytic record you will also see a link to the host
item under the 'Host records' column in the holdings table when viewing
the 'Analtyics' tab.

Host Record
|image657|

`Editing Analytics <#analyticediting>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have linked an analytic record incorrectly you can remove that
link by editing the item on the analytic record (not the host record).
To do this, go to the analytic record and click the 'Edit' button and
choose to 'Edit items'. To the left of each item you will see two
options.

Edit Analytic Item Record
|image658|

-  Clicking 'Edit in Host' will allow you to edit the item on the host
   record.

-  Clicking 'Delink' will remove the 773 field and the link between the
   analytic and the host.

`Editing Records <#editbibrec>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit a record you can click 'Edit Biblio' from the search results on
the cataloging page

Edit Biblio Option on Search Results
|image659|

or by clicking the Edit button on the Bibliographic Record and choosing
'Edit Record'

Edit Record Option on Bibliographic Record
|image660|

The record will open in the MARC editor

Editing MARC Record
|image661|

The alternative is to search via Z39.50 to overlay your record with a
fuller record found at another library. You can do this by choosing
'Replace Record via Z39.50' from the Edit menu.

Replace via Z39.50
|image662|

Once you choose that you will be brought to a Z39.50 search window to
search other libraries for the record in question.

Once you have made your edits (via either method) you can click 'Save'
at the top left of the editor.

You can also use the edit menu to add your own custom cover image if you
have either `OPACLocalCoverImages <#OPACLocalCoverImages>`__ and/or
`LocalCoverImages <#LocalCoverImages>`__ set to 'Display' by choosing
'Upload Image' from the menu.

Upload Image
|image663|

Choosing to 'Upload Image' will take you to the `Upload Local Cover
Image Tool <#uploadlocalimages>`__.

`Duplicating Records <#dupbibrec>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a copy of the record you need to catalog can't be found via
Z39.50. In these cases you can create a duplicate of similar record and
edit the necessary pieces to create a new record. To duplicate an
existing record click 'Edit as New (Duplicate)' from the Edit menu on
the Bibliographic Record

Edit as New (Duplicate) Bibliographic Record
|image664|

This will open a new MARC record with the fields filled in with the
values from the original Bibliographic Record.

New Duplicate Record
|image665|

`Attaching files to Records <#uploadbibfile>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to upload files to Koha you can do so with a few
settings.

-  You will need to ask your system administrator to set the
   'upload\_path' config variable to point to where the files will be
   stored

   -  You can see if your upload path is set correctly by visiting About
      Koha > System Information. If there is an error you will see it
      there.Upload Path Warning

-  You will want to be sure that your `OPACBaseURL <#OPACBaseURL>`__
   system preference is set appropriately

-  You will want to add the upload.pl plugin to the 856$u subfield in
   one (or multiple) of your `frameworks <#editsubfields>`__

Once you are all set up you can continue with cataloging as regular. You
will see a plugin icon next to the 856$u that will open up the upload
and/or search windowUpload file to record

From this menu you can click browse to find a file and attach it, or you
can search files you have uploaded previously using the search box. From
the search results you can choose which file to attach.Uploaded files

Once the file is chosen it will appear as a link in the MARC record and
on the detail display.

`Merging Records <#mergebibs>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To merge bibliographic records together you will want to go to the
Cataloging module and perform a search.

If you see duplicates on that search results screen you can check the
boxes next to the duplicates and click the 'Merge selected' button at
the top of the results.

Once you have selected the records you want to merge, click the 'Merge
selected' button at the top of the list. You will be asked which of the
records you would like to keep as your primary record and which will be
deleted after the merge. If the records were created using different
frameworks, Koha will also ask you what Framework you would like the
newly merged record to use.

Choose Primary Record for Merge
|image666|

You will be presented with the MARC for all of the records (each
accessible by tabs labeled with the bib numbers for those records). By
default the entire first record will be selected, uncheck the fields you
don't want in the final (destination) record and then move on to the
second tab to choose which fields should be in the final (destination)
record.

Merging Records
|image667|

Should you try to add a field that is not repeatable two times (like
choosing the 245 field from both record #1 and #2) you will be presented
with an error

Non-repeatable Error
|image668|

Below the records you are merging is an option to enter fields to report
on. This will allow you to control what fields you see on the merge
confirmation page:

Merge report fields
|image669|

If you enter nothing you will be presented with a confirmation of
biblionumbers only

Merge report
|image670|

If you enter fields you will see those on the confirmation page (you can
set defaults with the `MergeReportFields <#MergeReportFields>`__
preference)

Merge report
|image671|

Once you have completed your selections click the 'merge' button. The
primary record will now CONTAIN the data you chose for it as well as all
of the items/holdings from both bib records, and the second record will
be deleted.

    **Important**

    It is important to rebuild your zebra index immediately after
    merging records. If a search is performed for a record which has
    been deleted Koha will present the patrons with an error in the
    OPAC.

    **Note**

    If you would like you can also use the `Lists <#lists>`__ tool for
    merging records together. `Learn more here <#mergebibrecs>`__.

`Deleting Records <#deleterecord>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a bibliographic record simply choose the 'Edit' button and
select 'Delete record'

Delete record
|image672|

Bibliographic records can only be deleted one all items have been
deleted. If you try to delete a bibliographic record with items still
attached you will see that the delete option is grayed out.

`Item Records <#catitems>`__
----------------------------

In Koha each bibliographic record can have one or more items attached.
These items are sometimes referred to as holdings. Each item includes
information to the physical copy the library has.

`Adding Items <#addingitems>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After saving a new bibliographic record, you will be redirected to a
blank item record so that you can attach an item to the bibliographic
record. You can also click 'Add/Edit Items' from the cataloging search
results

Add/Edit Items Option on Search Results
|image674|

or you can add new item at any time by clicking 'New' on the
bibliographic record and choosing 'New Item'

New Item Button
|image675|

The item edit form will appear:

Add item form
|image676|

At the very least, if you plan on circulating the item, the following
fields should be entered for new items:

-  2 - Source of classification

-  a - Permanent location

-  b - Current location

-  o - Full call number

   -  If you'd like you can use the `call number browser
      plugin <#cnbrowseplugin>`__ for this field. If it's enabled you'll
      see a ... to the right of the field. When clicked that will open a
      call number browser window if the row is highlighted in Red then
      the call number is in use, if there is a thin Green line instead
      then the call number can be used.Call number browser

-  p - Barcode

-  v - Cost, replacement price

   -  This value will be charged to patrons when you mark an item they
      have checked out as 'Lost'

-  y - Koha item type

To make sure that these values are filled in you can mark them as
mandatory in the `framework <#marcbibframeworks>`__ you're using and
then they will appear in red with a 'required' label. The item will not
save until the required fields are filled in.

Required Item Subfield
|image677|

-  **Note**

       To make item subfields required in a framework you'll want to
       edit the 952 field in the `framework
       editor <#marcbibframeworks>`__.

Below the add form there are 3 buttons for adding the item

Add Item Buttons
|image678|

-  Add Item will add just the one item

-  Add & Duplicate will add the item and fill in a new form with the
   same values for your to alter

-  Add Multiple items will ask how many items and will then add that
   number of items adding +1 to the barcode so each barcode is unique

Your added items will appear above the add form once submitted

Items

Your items will also appear below the bibliographic details on the bib
record display.

List of Items on the Bib Record
|image680|

If you have
`SpineLabelShowPrintOnBibDetails <#SpineLabelShowPrintOnBibDetails>`__
set to 'Display' then there will also be a link to print a quick spine
label next to each item.

You can also filter the contents of your holdings table by clicking the
'Activate filters' links. This will show a row at the top where you can
type in any column to filter the results in the table.

`Editing Items <#editingitems>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Items can be edited in several ways.

-  Clicking 'Edit' and 'Edit Items' from the bibliographic record

   |image683|

   Which will open up a list of items where you can click the 'Actions'
   button to the left of the specific item you would like to edit and
   choose 'Edit'.

   Edit individual items

   Edit items in a batch
   |image687|

   This will open up the `batch item modification
   tool <#batchmodifyitems>`__ where you can edit all of the items on
   this record as a batch.

-  You can also enable
   `StaffDetailItemSelection <#StaffDetailItemSelection>`__ to have
   checkboxes appear to the left of each item on the detail display. You
   can then check off the items you would like to edit and click 'Modify
   selected items' at the top of the list.

   Editing selected items
   |image688|

-  You can click 'Edit' to the right of each item in the Holdings
   tabEdit individual items

-  There is also a link to Edit items from the search results in the
   staff clientEdit item on the search results

-  Finally you can use the `Batch Item
   Modification <#batchmodifyitems>`__ tool

`Quick Item Status Updates <#itemquickedit>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often circulation staff need to change the status of an item to Lost or
Damaged. This doesn't require you to edit the entire item record.
Instead clicking on the item barcode on the checkout summary or checkin
history will bring you to an item summary. You can also get to the item
summary by clicking on the Items tab to the left of the bib detail page.

Item Edit
|image689|

From this view you can mark an item lost by choosing a lost status from
the pull down and clicking the 'Set Status' button.

Edit Lost Status
|image690|

You can also mark an item as damaged by choosing a damaged status from
the pull down and clicking the 'Set Status' button.

Edit Damaged Status
|image691|

`Duplicating Items <#duplicateitem>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can easily duplicate each item by clicking the 'Action' button the
left of each item on the edit items screen

Edit individual items
|image692|

From here you can choose to 'Duplicate' the item and this will populate
the form with the values from the item you chose.

`Item Information <#iteminfo>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To the left of every bibliographic record there is a tab to view the
items.

Items Tab
|image693|

Clicking that tab will give you basic information about the items. From
here you can see basic information about the item such as the home
library, item type, collection code, call number and replacement price.
You can also see and edit the status information. If an item is marked
lost or withdrawn you will also see the date that status was applied.

In the History section you will see infomration about the check out
history of the item and if you ordered the item via the acquisitions
module then this section will include information about the order.

History with order info
|image694|

If the Order or Accession date is linked, clicking it will bring you to
the acquisitions information for that item.

`Moving Items <#moveitemrec>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Items can be moved from one bibliographic record to another using the
Attach Item option

Attach Item Option
|image695|

Visit the bibliographic record you want to attach the item to and choose
'Attach Item' from the 'Edit' menu.

Attach Item Form
|image696|

Simply enter the barcode for the item you want to move and click
'Select'

If you want to move all items to a new record creating only one
bibliographic record you can use the `Merge Records
tool <#mergebibrecs>`__ instead.

`Deleting Items <#deleteitems>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways to delete item records. If you only need to delete
one item you can do this by opening up the detail page for the bib
record and clicking the 'Edit' button at the top. From there you can
choose to 'Edit items'.

'Edit Items' menu option
|image697|

You will be presented with a list of items and next to each one will be
a link labeled 'Delete'. Click that link and if the item is not checked
out it will delete that item.

Delete link on the left
|image698|

If you know that all of the items attached to your record are not
currently checked out you can use the 'Delete all items' option under
the 'Edit menu' and it will remove all items from the record.

You can also enable
`StaffDetailItemSelection <#StaffDetailItemSelection>`__ to have
checkboxes appear to the left of each item on the detail display. You
can then check off the items you would like to delete and click 'Delete
selected items' at the top of the list.

Deleting selected items
|image699|

Finally you can use the `batch delete tool <#batchdeleteitems>`__ to
delete a batch of items.

`Item Specific Circulation History <#itemcirchistory>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each bibliographic record keeps a circulation history (with or without
the patron information depending on your settings), but each item also
has its own circulation history page. To see this, click on the 'Items'
tab to the left of the record you are viewing.

Items tab
|image700|

Below the 'History' heading is a link to 'View item's checkout history,'
clicking that will open up the item's history which will look slightly
different from the bibliographic record's history page.

`Authorities <#catauthorities>`__
---------------------------------

Authority records are a way of controlling fields in your MARC records.
Using authority records will provide you with control over subject
headings, personal names and places.

`Adding Authorities <#addauthorities>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new authority record you can either choose the authority type
from the 'New Authority' button or search another library by clicking
the 'New from Z39.50' button.

New Authority Record Options
|image702|

If you choose to enter a new authority from scratch, the form that
appears will allow you to enter all of the necessary details regarding
your authority record.

New Authority Record
|image703|

To expand collapsed values simply click on the title and the subfields
will appear. To duplicate a field or subfield just click the plus sign
(+) to the right of the label. To use field helper plugins simply click
the ellipsis (...) to the right of the field.

When linking authorities to other headings, you can use the authority
finder plugin by clicking the ellipsis (...) to the right of the field.

Authority search plugin
|image704|

From there you can search your authority file for the authority to link.
If you can't find the authority to link, you can click the 'Create new'
button and add the necessary authority for the link. This plugin also
allows for you to choose the link relationship between the authorities.

Authority relationships
|image705|

If you choose to search another library for the authority record you
will be presented with a search box

Authority Z39.50 Search
|image706|

From the results you can choose the 'Import' link to the right of the
record you would like to add to Koha

Authority Z39.50 Results
|image707|

You will then be presented with the form to edit the authority before
saving it to your system

Imported Authority
|image708|

`Searching Authorities <#searchauthorities>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the authorities page you can search for existing terms and the
bibliographic records they are attached to.

Authority Search
|image709|

From the results you will see the authority record, how many
bibliographic records it is attached to, an 'Actions' menu that includes
the ability to `edit <#editauthorities>`__, `merge <#authoritymerge>`__
and `delete <#editauthorities>`__ (if there are no bibliographic records
attached).

Authority Search Results
|image710|

Clicking on the Details link to the right of the authority record
summary will open the full record and the option to edit the record.

Authority Record
|image711|

If the authority has See Alsos in it you will see those broken out on
the search results, clicking the linked headings will run a search for
that heading instead.

See Also in Authorities
|image712|

`Editing Authorities <#editauthorities>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authorities can be edited by clicking on the authority summary from the
search results and then clicking the 'Edit' button above the record. Or
by clicking on the 'Edit' link to the left of the authority on the
search results.

Edit Authority Record
|image713|

Once you've made the necessary edits, simply click 'Save' and
`dontmerge <#dontmerge>`__ is set to 'Do', Koha will immediately update
all of the bib records linked to the authority with the new authority
record's data. If dontmerge is set to "Don't" then Koha won't edit bib
records when changes are made to authorities, rather, this is done later
by the `merge\_authority.pl cronjob <#mergeauthcron>`__.

To delete an authority record you first must make sure it's not linked
to any bibliographic records. If it is not used by any bibliographic
records a 'Delete' link will appear to the right of the record on the
search results and as a button that appears after clicking on the
summary of the authority record.

`Merging Authorities <#authoritymerge>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have duplicate authority records you can merge them together by
clicking the 'Merge' link, found in the actions menu, next to two
results on an authority search.

Duplicate authorities results
|image714|

After clicking 'Merge' on the first result you will see that authority
listed at the top of the results.

Merging authorities results
|image715|

Next you need to click 'Merge' next to the second result you'd like to
merge.

You will be asked which of the two records you would like to keep as
your primary record and which will be deleted after the merge.

Merging authorities
|image716|

You will be presented with the MARC for both of the records (each
accessible by tabs labeled with the authority numbers for those
records). By default the entire first record will be selected, uncheck
the fields you don't want in the final (destination) record and then
move on to the second tab to choose which fields should be in the final
(destination) record.

Authorities to merge
|image717|

Once you have completed your selections click the 'Merge' button. The
primary record will now contain the data you chose for it and the second
record will be deleted.

`Handling On Order Items and Holds <#onorderitemholds>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you tend to import your MARC records when you have ordered the book
(as opposed to when you receive the books), and allow patrons to place
holds on those books, you may need to add item records to the \*.mrc
file before importing.

The easiest way to import your latest order is to first run your records
through `MARCEdit <http://marcedit.reeset.net/>`__. Download your MARC
records, saving them to your desktop or some other location you use/will
remember. If you have MARCEdit already installed you should simply have
to double click on your MARC records, and they will automatically open
in MARCEdit.

    **Important**

    This tutorial was written with MARCEdit version 5.2.3769.41641 on
    Windows XP, instructions may be different if your version or
    operating system is different.

-  Your original file will automatically be in the input; ensure
   MarcBreaker is chosen, and then click "Execute"

   MarcBreaker
   |image719|

-  You will be presented with a summary of the records processed at the
   bottom of the screen

   MarcBreaker Summary
   |image720|

-  Click 'Edit Records' to continue on to adding item records

-  Your screen will be replaced with a larger screen containing the MARC
   records

   MARC file for editing
   |image721|

-  Click on Tools > Add/Edit Field

   Add/Delete Field
   |image722|

-  Enter in the Koha specific item info

   Add 942 Field
   |image723|

   -  In the Field box, type 942

   -  In the Field Data box, type \\\\$c and the item type code
      (\\\\$cBOOK in this example)

   -  Check the 'Insert last' option

   -  Click 'Add Field'

-  Enter in the item record data

   Add 952 Field
   |image724|

   -  In the Field box, type 952

   -  In the Field Data box, type
      $7ORDERED\_STATUS$aPERM\_LOC$bCURR\_LOC$cSHELVING\_LOCATION$eSOURCE\_OF\_ACQ$yITEM\_TYPE

      -  ex. $7-1$aCPL$bCPL$cNEW$eBrodart$yBOOK

         -  In a default install of Koha -1 is the value for the Ordered
            status

      -  You may want to look at other subfields you would like data in
         -- for example, changing the collection code to put all the
         items in the same collection (8), automatically fill in the
         acquisition date (d), or put in a public note (z).

      -  Be sure you use the $ to separate subfields; adding each
         subfield on a separate line will cause that many items to be
         imported with your MARC record (in the example above, four
         items, each with one of those subfields corrected)

      -  Make sure you look at the Administration > Authorized Values in
         Koha to put the correct code into the field

   -  Check the 'Insert last' option

   -  Click 'Add Field'

-  Close the field editor window

-  Click on File > Compile into MARC

   Compile into MARC
   |image725|

-  Choose where to save your file

Now you want to go into your Koha system and follow the instructions for
`importing MARC records <#stagemarc>`__.

Once the item has come in, you will need to go to the item record and
individually change the item to have the correct barcode, and manually
change the status from Ordered to the blank line in the Not for Loan
field.

    **Note**

    If you purchase your cataloged item records, you may want to request
    your vendor put in the information you need into the MARC records
    for you; that way, you could import the edited-by-the-vendor file,
    overwriting the current record, automatically replacing the data
    with what you need.

Course Reserves
===============

The course reserves module in Koha allows you to temporarily move items
to 'reserve' and assign different circulation rules to these items while
they are being used for a specific course.

`Course Reserves Setup <#coursesetup>`__
----------------------------------------

Before using Course Reserves you will need to do some set up.

First you will need to enable course reserves by setting the
`UseCourseReserves <#UseCourseReserves>`__ preference to 'Use'.

Next you will need to have all of your course instructors `added as
patrons <#addnewpatron>`__.

Next you will want to add a couple of new `authorized
values <#newauthval>`__ for Departments and Terms.

You may also want to create new `item types <#additemtype>`__,
`collection codes <#ccode>`__ and/or `shelving
locations <#shelvelocvals>`__ to make it clear that the items are on
reserve to your patrons. You will also want to be sure to confirm that
your `circulation and fine rules <#circfinerules>`__ are right for your
new item types (whether they be hourly or daily loans).

`Adding Courses <#addingcourses>`__
-----------------------------------

Once you have completed your set up for Course Reserves you can start
creating courses and adding titles to the reserve list.

Course Reserves Admin
|image726|

From the main course reserves page you can add a new course by clicking
the 'New course' button at the top left.

Add a new course
|image727|

Your new course will need a Department, Number and Name at the bare
minimum. You can also add in additional details like course section
number and term. To link an instructor to this course simply start
typing their name and Koha will search your patron database to find you
the right person.

Instrcutor search
|image728|

Once the instructor you want appears just click their name and they will
be added. You can repeat this for all instructors on this course. Each
instructor will appear above the search box and can be removed by
clicking the 'Remove' link to the right of their name.

Instructors
|image729|

If you would like your course to show publicly you'll want to be sure to
check the 'Enabled?' box before saving your new course.

Once your course is saved it will show on the main course reserves page
and be searchable by any field in the course.

Courses
|image730|

`Adding Reserve Materials <#addreserves>`__
-------------------------------------------

Before adding reserve materials you will need at least one course to add
them to. To add materials visit the Course Reserves module.

Courses
|image731|

Click on the title of the course you would like to add materials to.

Course administration
|image732|

At the top of the course description click the 'Add reserves' button to
add titles to this reserve list. You will be asked to enter the barcode
for the reserve item.

Add item to reserve
|image733|

After you are done scanning the barcodes to add to the course you can
see them on the course page

Course with reserves
|image734|

`Course Reserves in the OPAC <#opaccoursereserves>`__
-----------------------------------------------------

Once you have enabled Course Reserves and added courses you will see a
link to Course Reserves below your search box in the OPAC.

Course Reserves Link
|image735|

Clicking that link will show you your list of enabled courses (if you
have only one course you will just see the contents of that one course).

Course list in the OPAC
|image736|

You can search course reserves by any field (course number, course name,
instructor name, department) that is visible in the list of courses.
Clicking a course name will show you the details and reserve items.

Serials
=======

Serials actions can be accessed by going to the More menu at the top of
your screen and choosing Serials or by clicking Serials on the main Koha
staff client page. The Serials module in Koha is used for keeping track
of journals, newspapers and other items that come on a regular schedule.
As with all modules, make sure you go through the related
`Implementation Checklist <#impserials>`__ before using the Serials
module.

-  *Get there:* More > Serials

`Manage Serial Frequencies <#serialfreq>`__
-------------------------------------------

Koha keeps a record of publication frequencies for easy management and
duplication.

-  *Get there:* More > Serials > Manage frequencies

From this page you can view all of the existing frequencies in your
system

Frequencies
|image738|

and create new ones.

New frequency
|image739|

`Manage Serial Numbering Patterns <#serialpatterns>`__
------------------------------------------------------

Everytime you create a new numbering pattern in serials you can save it
for later use. These patters are accessible via the Manage numbering
patterns page.

-  *Get there:* More > Serials > Manage numbering patterns

This page will list for you the numbering patterns you have saved in the
past as well as a few canned patterns.

Number patterns
|image740|

    **Note**

    If you have upgraded from a previous version of Koha you will see
    'Backup patterns' listed for patterns used in version before Koha
    3.14. This is how Koha saved your old numbering patterns. You can
    edit these to give them more meaningful names from here.

It will also allow you to create a new numbering pattern without first
adding a subscription. To add new new pattern click 'New numbering
pattern' at the top of the list of patterns.

New number pattern
|image741|

`Custom Subscription Fields <#serialfields>`__
----------------------------------------------

This module will allow you to add custom fields to your serial
subscriptions for reporting and searching.

-  *Get there:* Serials > Add subscription fields

To add custom fields simply click the 'Add subscription fields' link on
the left of the Serial page and choose the 'New field' buttonAdd
subscription fields

The form that appears will ask for either an authorized value or a marc
field to populate the field with

Add field

For example you might want to track which department you're ordering for
or the collection code for this serialAdd department

This data will then show when you are adding a subscriptionAdd field
value

and when you view the subscriptionShow field

and when you search subscriptions (if you chose to make it
'searchable')Searchable field

`Add a subscription <#newsubscription>`__
-----------------------------------------

Subscriptions can be added by clicking the 'New' button on any
bibliographic record

New Subscription Button
|image742|

Or by visiting the Serials module and clicking 'New Subscription'

New Subscription Button
|image743|

If you are entering a new subscription from the Serials module you will
be presented with a blank form (if creating new from a bibliographic
record the form will include the bib info).

Add a new subscription (1/2)
|image744|

-  'Librarian' field will show the logged in librarian's username

-  'Vendor' can be found by either searching vendors entered via the
   `Acquisitions module <#acqmodule>`__ or entering the vendor ID number

   -  Vendor information is not required

   -  In order to claim missing and late issues you need to enter vendor
      information

      Vendor Missing Warning
      |image745|

-  'Biblio' is the MARC record you'd like to link this subscription to

   -  This can be done by searching for an existing record by clicking
      on the 'Search for Biblio' link below the boxes or by entering the
      bib number for a record in the first box. Only if you search with
      the field between the parenthesis.

-  Next you can choose whether a new item is created when receiving an
   issue (if you barcode issues you'll want to create an item at this
   time)

-  In order to determine how to handle irregularities in your
   subscription answer 'When there is an irregular issue', if the
   numbers are always sequential you'll want to pick 'Keep issue number'

-  Checking the 'Manual history' box will allow you to enter serials
   outside the prediction pattern once the subscription is saved by
   going to the 'Planning' tab on the subscription detail page.Manual
   History

-  'Call Number' is for your item's call number or call number prefix

-  'Library' is the branch that owns this subscription.

   -  If more than one library subscribes to this serial you will need
      to create a subscription for each library

   -  This can be done easily by using the 'Edit as New (Duplicate)'
      option found on the subscription information page and changing
      only the 'Library' field

      New Duplicate Subscription
      |image746|

-  Use the 'Public Note' for any notes you would like to appear in the
   OPAC for the patrons

-  'Nonpublic Note' should be used for notes that are only visible to
   the librarians via the staff client

-  The 'Patron notification' option lets you pick a notice to send to
   patrons who subscribe to updates on this serial via the OPAC.

   -  For this option to appear you need to make sure that you have a
      Routing List notice set up in the `Notices Tool <#notices>`__

-  'Location' is for the shelving location

-  The 'Grace period' is the number of days before an issue is
   automatically moved from 'Expected' status to 'Waiting' and how many
   days before an issue is automatically moved from 'Waiting' status to
   'Late'

-  The Staff and OPAC Display options allow you to control how many
   issues appear by default on bibliographic records in the Staff Client
   and the OPAC

   -  If no values are entered in these fields, they will use the
      `OPACSerialIssueDisplayCount <#OPACSerialIssueDisplayCount>`__ and
      `StaffSerialIssueDisplayCount <#StaffSerialIssueDisplayCount>`__
      system preference values

Once that data is filled in you can click 'Next' to enter the prediction
pattern information.

Add a new subscription (2/2)
|image747|

-  In 'First issue publication date' you want to enter the date of the
   issue you have in your hand, the date from which the prediction
   pattern will start

-  There are several pre-defined options for the 'Frequency' of
   publication all of which are visible alongside your own custom
   frequencies by visiting '`Manage frequencies <#serialfreq>`__'

   -  Without periodicy: some very specific (usually high level science
      journals) don't have a true periodicity. When you subscribe to the
      title, you subscribe for 6 issues, which can arrive in 1 year...
      or 2... There is no regularity or known schedule.

   -  Unknown select this if none of the other choices are relevant

   -  Irregular: The journal is not "regular" but has a periodicity. You
      know that it comes out on January, then in October and December,

-  'Subscription start date' is the date at which the subscription
   begins. This is used for setting up renewal alerts

-  'Subscription end date' should only be entered for subscriptions that
   have ended (if you're entering in a backlog of serials)

-  'Numbering pattern' will help you determine how the numbers are
   printed for each issue. Patterns entered here are saved and editable
   at any time by visiting '`Manage numbering
   patterns <#serialpatterns>`__'

   -  Start with the numbering on the issue you have in hand, the
      numbering that matches the date you entered in the 'First issue
      publication' field

   -  You can choose to create your own numbering pattern by choosing
      'None of the above' and clicking the 'Show/Hide Advanced Pattern'
      button at the bottom of the form

-  The 'Locale' option is useful when you want to display days, month or
   season. For example, if you have a German serial, you can use the
   German locale option to display days, etc. in German.

-  Once a 'Numbering pattern' is chosen the number formula will
   appear.Numbering Forumla

   -  The 'Begins with' number is the number of the issue you're holding
      in your hand.

   -  The 'Inner counter' is used to tell Koha where the "receiving
      cycle" starts

      -  For example: If the first issue to receive is "vol. 4, no. 1,
         iss. 796", you need to set up "inner counter = 0" But if it's
         "vol. 4, no. 2, iss. 797", the inner counter should be "1".

   -  After filling in this data click the 'Test prediction pattern'
      button to see what issues the system will generate, if there are
      irregularities you can choose which issues don't exist from the
      list presented.

Acquisitions
============

The Koha Acquisitions module provides a way for the library to record
orders placed with vendors and manage purchase budgets.

-  *Get there:* More > Acquisitions

`Setup <#acqsetup>`__
---------------------

Before using the Acquisitions Module you will want to make sure that you
have completed all of the set up.

First, set your `Acquisitions System Preferences <#acqprefs>`__ and
`Acquisitions Administration <#acqadmin>`__ to match your library's
workflow. Before setting your `EDI Accounts <#ediaccounts>`__ and
`Library EANs <#libraryeans>`__ you will need to have `entered your
vendors <#addacqvendor>`__.

On the main acquisitions page you will see your library's funds listed.

Acquisitions Funds Summary
|image781|

    **Note**

    If the total line is confusing for the funds you have set up you can
    hide it by adding

`Managing Suggestions <#managesuggest>`__
-----------------------------------------

Purchase suggestions can be generated in one of two ways. You can create
suggestions via the staff client either for the library or `on the
patron's behalf <#patronsuggestions>`__ from their record. Depending on
your settings in the `suggestion <#suggestionspref>`__ system
preference, patrons may also be able to make purchase suggestions via

Your suggestions will be sorted into several tabs: Accepted, Pending,
Checked, Ordered and/or Rejected. Each accepted or rejected suggestion
will show the name of the librarian who managed the suggestion and the
reason they gave for accepting or rejecting it (found under 'Status').

An 'Accepted' suggestion is one that you have marked as 'Accepted' using
the form below the suggestions. A 'Pending' suggestion is one that is
awaiting action from the library. A 'Checked' suggestion is one that has
been marked as 'Checked' using the form before the suggestions. An
'Ordered' suggestion is on that has been ordered using the '`From a
purchase suggestion <#orderfromsuggestion>`__' link in your basket. A
'Rejected' suggestion is one that you have marked at 'Rejected' using
the form below the list of suggestions.

For libraries with lots of suggestions, there are filters on the left
hand side of the Manage Suggestions page to assist in limiting the
number of titles displayed on the screen.

Suggestion Filtering
|image797|

Clicking on the blue headings will expand the filtering options and

Slips <#notices>`__ tool with the `TO\_PROCESS <#toprocessnotice>`__
notice) to the fund owner that there is a suggestion ready for them to
manage if you have turned on the `cron job to generate these
notices <#emailsuggestfund>`__.

Once you have clicked 'Submit' the suggestion will be moved to the

`Create a basket group <#acqbasketgroup>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A basket group is simply a group of baskets. In some libraries, you have
several staff members that create baskets, and, at the end of a period
of time, someone then groups them together to send to the vendor in
bulk. That said, it is possible to have one basket in a basket group if
that's the workflow used in your library.

`EDI Setup <#edisetup>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you begin ordering using EDI you will want to take the following
steps:

-  Ask your vendor/bookseller/jobber for `connection
   information <#ediquestions>`__

   -  It might also be beneficial to ask for a few sample EDIFACT files
      from the vendor

-  Share with your vendor/bookseller/jobber your `library
   codes <#libsgroups>`__, `item type codes <#itemtypeadmin>`__, `fund
   codes <#funds>`__, and any other codes or `authorized
   values <#authorizedvalues>`__ they might need for creating your MARC
   order records

-  Communicate with your support provider or the community about whether
   you will need a plugin based on your vendor's answers

   -  For example ByWater Solutions has published plugins for specific
      vendors here:
      https://github.com/bywatersolutions/koha-plugin-edifact-enhanced

-  `Enter the vendor/bookseller/jobber <#addacqvendor>`__ in
   Acquisitions

-  Review your `Acquisitions system preferences <#acqprefs>`__

   -  Be sure to fill in the `MarcFieldsToOrder <#MarcFieldsToOrder>`__
      preference with values for order files

-  Enter your `EDI Accounts <#ediaccounts>`__

-  Enter your `Library EANs <#libraryeans>`__

-  Turn on the `EDI Cron <#edicron>`__ so that it can process files

`EDI Ordering <#ediordering>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step in ordering using EDI happens on the book vendor's
website. Each seller will use different language, but you will need to
place your order on their site and then download the MARC order file.
Some language that you might see included "basket", "order", "cart",
and/or "MARC order." Once you have this MARC file downloaded to your
computer you will want to log in to Koha and continue the process there.

Visit the `Stage MARC Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__ tool and upload
your file. Once presented with the confirmation screen proceed to
Acquisitions.

In Acquisitions `create a basket <#createacqbasket>`__ for the vendor
you ordered from. From the basket, choose to `order from a staged
file <#orderfromstagedfile>`__ and click 'Order' next to the file you
downloaded from your vendor and staged in Koha.

From the confirmation screen you will see all of the data in the MARC
file related to your order. If you are not seeing fields such as fund
and quanity filled in then be sure to confirm that your
`MarcFieldsToOrder <#MarcFieldsToOrder>`__ preference is set right.

Once you have added all of the items to the basket you can click the
'Create EDIFACT order' button.

EDIFACT Order

This will generate a pending file in the `EDIFACT
Messages <#edifactmsg>`__ in Koha. The pending files will be processed
by the `EDI Cron Job <#edicron>`__ and sent to your vendor.

`EDI Invoicing <#ediinvoice>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the book vendor is done processing your files they will send an
invoice via EDI as well. The `EDI Cron Job <#edicron>`__ will grab
invoices and mark items found in the invoice as received and update your
funds without any need for manual intervention.

`EDIFACT Messages <#edifactmsg>`__
----------------------------------

A log of all messages sent and received via EDIFACT can be found under
EDIFACT Messages. EDIFACT Messages

Reports
=======

Reports in Koha are a way to gather data. Reports are used to generate
statistics, member lists, shelving lists, or any list of data in your
database.

-  *Get there:* More > Reports

`Custom Reports <#customreports>`__
-----------------------------------

Koha's data is stored in a MySQL database which means that librarians
can generate nearly any report they would like by either using the
`Guided Reports Wizard <#quidedreportwizard>`__ or writing their own
`SQL query <#reportfromsql>`__.

`Add Custom Report <#customreport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Guided Report Wizard <#quidedreportwizard>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The guided report wizard will walk you through a six step process to
generate a report.

Step 1: Choose the module you want to report on. This will determine
what tables and fields are available for you to query.

'Report is public' should be left to the default of 'No' in most cases.
A report can be made public if you intend to allow access to it through
the JSON webservice interface. This is a system that can be used by
developers to make custom presentations of the data from the report, for
example displaying it using a graphing API. To learn more speak to your
local developer.

-  A public report is accessible via a URL that looks like this:
   http://MYOPAC/cgi-bin/koha/svc/report?id=REPORTID

Chose Module for Report
|image881|

    **Note**

    If your system administrator has set up memcache on your server you
    might see one more option for the Cache expiry. This is related to
    your public reports. If you make the report public then it's
    constantly running and will cause a large load on your system.
    Setting this value prevents that.Cache expiry

Step 2: Choose a report type. For now, Tabular is the only option
available.

Report Type
|image882|

Step 3: Choose the fields you want in your report. You can select
multiple fields and add them all at once by using CTRL+Click on each
item you want to add before clicking the Add button.

Select database fields to query
|image883|

Step 4: Choose any limits you might want to apply to your report (such
as item types or branches). If you don't want to apply any limits,
simply click Next instead of making an option.

Choose limits
|image884|

Step 5: Perform math functions. If you don't want to do any
calculations, simply click Next instead of making an option.

Choose math functions
|image885|

Step 6: Choose data order. If you want the data to print out in the
order it's found in the database, simply click Finish.

Choose ordering
|image886|

When you are finished you will be presented with the SQL generated by
the report wizard. From here you can choose to save the report by
clicking 'Save' or copy the SQL and make edits to it by hand.

Custom Report Confirmation
|image887|

If you choose to save the report you will be asked to name your report,
sort it in to groups and subgroups and enter any notes regarding it.

Save custom report
|image888|

Once your report is saved it will appear on the 'Use Saved' page with
all other saved reports.

Saved Reports list
|image889|

From here you can make edits, run the report, or schedule a time to have
the report run. To find the report you created you can sort by any of
the columns by clicking the on the column header (creation date is the
best bet for finding the report you just added). You can also filter
your results using the filter menu on the left or use the tabs to find
reports based on your custom groups.

`Report from SQL <#reportfromsql>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the report wizard, you have the option to write your own
queries using SQL. To find reports written by other Koha users, visit
the Koha Wiki: http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library.
You can also find your database structure in
/installer/data/mysql/kohastructure.sql or online at:
`http://schema.koha-community.org <http://schema.koha-community.org/>`__.

To add your query, click the link to 'Create from SQL' on the main
reports module or the 'New report' button at the top of the 'Saved
reports' page.

New SQL Report
|image890|

Fill in the form presented

Create Report from SQL
|image891|

-  The 'Name' is what will appear on the Saved Reports page to help you
   identify the report later. It will also be searchable using the
   filters found the left of the Saved Reports page.

-  You can use the 'Report group' to organize your reports so that you
   can easily filter reports by groups. Report groups are set in the
   `REPORT\_GROUP <#reportgroup>`__ authorized value category or can be
   added on the fly when creating the report by choosing the 'or create'
   radio button.Report group

   -  **Note**

          If you're adding a report group on the fly, remember that you
          code should be fewer than 10 characters and should not include
          special characters or spaces.

-  You can use 'Report subgroup' to further organize your reports so
   that you can easily filter reports by groups and subgroups. Report
   subgroups are set in the `REPORT\_SUBGROUP <#reportsubgroup>`__
   authorized value category or can be added on the fly when creating
   the report by choosing the 'or create' radio button.

   Report subgroup
   |image892|

   -  **Note**

          If you're adding a report subgroup on the fly, remember that
          you code should be fewer than 10 characters and should not
          include special characters or spaces.

-  'Report is public' should be left to the default of 'No' in most
   cases. A report can be made public if you intend to allow access to
   it through the JSON webservice interface. This is a system that can
   be used by developers to make custom presentations of the data from
   the report, for example displaying it using a graphing API. To learn
   more speak to your local developer.

   -  A public report is accessible via a URL that looks like this:
      http://MYOPAC/cgi-bin/koha/svc/report?id=REPORTID

-  'Notes' will also appear on the Saved Reports page, this can be used
   to provide more details about the report or tips on how to enter
   values when it runs

-  The type should always be 'Tabular' at this time since the other
   formats have not been implemented

-  In the 'SQL' box you will type or paste the SQL for the report

-  If you feel that your report might be too resource intensive you
   might want to consider using runtime parameters to your query.
   Runtime parameters basically make a filter appear before the report
   is run to save your system resources.

   There is a specific syntax that Koha will understand as 'ask for
   values when running the report'. The syntax is <<Question to
   ask\|authorized\_value>>.

   -  The << and >> are just delimiters. You must put << at the
      beginning and >> at the end of your parameter

   -  The 'Question to ask' will be displayed on the left of the string
      to enter.

   -  The authorized\_value can be omitted if not applicable. If it
      contains an authorized value category, or branches or itemtype or
      categorycode or biblio\_framework, a list with the Koha authorized
      values will be displayed instead of a free field Note that you can
      have more than one parameter in a given SQL Note that entering
      nothing at run time won't probably work as you expect. It will be
      considered as "value empty" not as "ignore this parameter". For
      example entering nothing for : "title=<<Enter title>>" will
      display results with title='' (no title). If you want to have to
      have something not mandatory, use "title like <<Enter title>>" and
      enter a % at run time instead of nothing

   Examples:

   -  SELECT surname,firstname FROM borrowers WHERE branchcode=<<Enter
      patrons library\|branches>> AND surname like <<Enter filter for
      patron surname (% if none)>>

   -  SELECT \* FROM items WHERE homebranch = <<Pick your
      branch\|branches>> and barcode like <<Partial barcode value here>>

   -  SELECT title , author FROM biblio WHERE frameworkcode=<<Enter the
      frameworkcode\|biblio\_framework>>

       **Note**

       To generate a date picker calendar to the right of the field when
       running a report you can use the 'date' keyword like this:
       <<Enter Date\|date>>

       Date Picker
       |image893|

       **Note**

       You have to put "%" in a text box to 'leave it blank'. Otherwise,
       it literally looks for "" (empty string) as the value for the
       field.

       **Important**

       In addition to using any authorized value code to generate a
       dropdown, you can use the following values as well: Framework
       codes (biblio\_framework), Branches (branches), Item Types
       (itemtypes) and Patron Categories (categorycode). For example a
       branch pull down would be generated like this
       <<Branch\|branches>>

       Branch pull down
       |image894|

    **Note**

    There is a limit of 10,000 records put on SQL statements entered in
    Koha. To get around this you want to add 'LIMIT 100000' to the end
    of your SQL statement (or any other number above 10,000).

    **Note**

    If your system administrator has set up memcache on your server you
    might see one more option for the Cache expiry. This is related to
    your public reports. If you make the report public then it's
    constantly running and will cause a large load on your system.
    Setting this value prevents that.Cache expiry

Once everything is entered click the 'Save Report' button and you'll be
presented with options to run it. Once a report is saved you do not have
to recreate it you can simply find it on the Saved Reports page and
`run <#runcustomreport>`__ or `edit <#editcustomreports>`__ it.

`Duplicate Report <#duplicatereport>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reports can also be added by duplicating an existing report. Visit the
'Saved reports' page to see all of the reports listed on your system
already.

Saved Reports
|image895|

To the right of every report there is an 'Actions' pull down. Clickin
that and choose 'Duplicate' to use an existing report as the basis for
your new report. That will populate the new report form with the
existing SQL for easy editing and resaving.

`Edit Custom Reports <#editcustomreports>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every report can be edited from the reports lists. To see the list of
reports already stored in Koha, click 'Use Saved.'

Saved Reports
|image896|

To find the report you'd like to edit you can sort by any of the columns
by clicking the on the column header. You can also filter your results
using the filter menu on the left or use the tabs to find reports based
on your custom groups.

From this list you can edit any custom report by clicking 'Actions' to
the right of the report and choosing 'Edit' from the menu that appears.

For more on searching check the '`Searching <#searching>`__' chapter in
this manual.

`Results Overview <#opacresultsoverview>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After performing a search the number of results found for your search
will appear above the results

Total Results
|image938|

By default your search results will be sorted based on your
`OPACdefaultSortField and OPACdefaultSortOrder <#opacdefaultsort>`__
system preference values. To change this you can choose another sorting
method from the pull down on the right.

Results Sorting Options
|image939|

Under each title on your results list a series of values from your
leader will appear. It is important to note that this has nothing to do
with the item types or collection codes you have applied to your
records, this data is all pulled from your fixed fields. This can be
turned on or off with the
`DisplayOPACiconsXSLT <#DisplayOPACiconsXSLT>`__ system preference.

Leader Visualization
|image940|

Below each title you will see the availability for the items attached to
the record.

    **Note**

    Even if you filtered on one library location all locations that hold
    the item will appear on the search results.

    **Important**

    An item's hold status doesn't not affect whether or not the item is
    'available' until the item is in 'waiting' status. Items with
    on-shelf holds will show as available until a librarian has pulled
    them from the shelf and checked the item in make it show 'waiting'.

|image964|

`Lists & Cart <#opaclistscart>`__
---------------------------------

A cart is a temporary holding place for records you're interested in
finding during this session. That means that once you log out of the
OPAC or close the browser you lose the items in your cart. A list is a
more permanent location for saving items. To learn more about lists,
check the `Lists in the Staff Client <#stafflists>`__ chapter of this
manual.

`Lists <#opaclists>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patrons can manage their own private lists by visiting the 'my lists'
section of their account.

Lists Management
|image965|

`Creating Lists <#opacaddlists>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lists can also be created by choosing the 'New List' option in the 'Add
to' menu on the search results

Add to New List
|image966|

To create a list the patron simply needs to click the 'New List' link
and populate the form that appears

Create a new list
|image967|

The only field required is the 'List Name,' but the patron can also
choose how they want the list sorted and if the list is public or
private.

-  A Private List is managed by you and can be seen only by you
   (depending on your permissions settings below)

-  A Public List can be seen by everybody, but managed only by you
   (depending on your permissions settings below)

    **Important**

    If you aren't allowing patrons to create public lists with the
    `OpacAllowPublicListCreation <#OpacAllowPublicListCreation>`__
    preference then patrons will only be able to create private lists.

    Create a new private list
    |image968|

-  Finally decide what your permissions will be on the list. You can all
   or disallow:

   -  anyone else to add entries

   -  anyone to remove his own contributed entries

      -  **Note**

-  If allowed by your
   `OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture <#OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture>`__
   preference, the 'Hold Starts on Date' column will show. This field
   allows the patron to have their hold start on a future date.

-  By default holds placed in the system remain until canceled, but if
   the patron fills in a 'Hold Not Needed After' date then the hold has
   an expiration date.

   -  **Important**

          Expired holds are removed by the `Expired Holds Cron
          Job <#expiredholdscron>`__, this is not an automatic process

`reviewson <#reviewson>`__ preference set to allow this. Each
bibliographic record has a comments tab below the bibliographic
information.

Pending Comment
|image993|

Once the comment is approved the patron will see the number of comments
on the 'Comments' tab and their comment labeled amongst the other
comments. If you have set your
`ShowReviewerPhoto <#ShowReviewerPhoto>`__ preference to 'Show' then
you'll see the patron's photo pulled from the
`Libravatar <https://www.libravatar.org>`__ library.

Your Comments
|image994|

Other patrons will see the comment with the name of the patron who left
the comment (unless you have set the `ShowReviewer <#ShowReviewer>`__
preference to not show patron names).

Comment by other patron
|image995|

If you have your `OpacShowRecentComments <#OpacShowRecentComments>`__
set to show then you'll see the approved comments on that page.

installed, you will see a folder icon in the address bar to the right of
the URL. Clicking that folder will open up a list of titles on the page
for you to pick from to add to Zotero.

|image998|

`Custom RSS Feeds <#customrss>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using misc/cronjobs/rss/rss.pl you can generate an RSS feed for any SQL
query (for example a new acquisitions RSS feed). rss.pl is run on the
command line to produce an RSS XML document.

The output should be placed in a directory accessible to the OPAC (or
staff) web interface so that users can download the RSS feed.

An example of usage can be found at: misc/cronjobs/rss.pl
lastAcquired.conf

Normally rss.pl should be run periodically (e.g., daily) to keep the
feed up-to-date.

The configuration file (e.g., lastAcquired.conf) lists

-  name of the template file to use

-  path of output file

-  SQL query

rss.pl runs the SQL query, then feeds the output of the query through
the template to produce the output file.

    **Important**

    To use custom RSS feeds you need to turn on the rss.pl cron job.

`OPAC Self Registration <#selfregistration>`__
----------------------------------------------

If you allow it, patrons can register for their own accounts via the
OPAC. If you have the
`PatronSelfRegistration <#PatronSelfRegistration>`__ preference set to
'Allow' then patrons will see a link to register below the log in box on
the right of the main OPAC page.

Registration link in OPAC
|image999|

When the patron clicks the 'Register here' link they will be brough to a
registration page. The options on the registration page can be conrolled
by editing the
`PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerMandatoryField <#PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerMandatoryField>`__
and the
`PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerUnwantedField <#PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerUnwantedField>`__
preferences.

Registration form
|image1000|

Once the patron has confirmed submitted their registration they will
either be sent an email to confirm their account (if you have the
`PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail <#PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail>`__
preference to require this) or presented with their new username and
password.

New account confirmation
|image1001|

Patrons registered in this way will not have a cardnumber until assigned
one by the library, but will have access to all OPAC functionality
immediately. For this reason it is recommended that you:

-  set up a provisional `patron category <#addingpatroncat>`__ for self
   registered patrons (such as 'Self Registered) instead of using an
   existing patron category and set that value in the
   `PatronSelfRegistrationDefaultCategory <#PatronSelfRegistrationDefaultCategory>`__
   preference

-  give this patron category minimal circulation privileges in the
   `Circulation and Fine Rules <#circfinerules>`__ (such as allowing a
   couple holds, but no check outs)

That way patrons will either have to come in to the library to verify
their identity before given a cardnumber and the ability to check items
out or the library will have to come up with internal policy on
generating cardnumbers before providing them to self registered patrons.
Once this is done the library can change the category to one that is
more appropriate (be it an adult, resident, non resident, student, etc)
and add a cardnumber/barcode.

`My Account <#opacmyaccount>`__
-------------------------------

From the OPAC patrons can log in and access their account if you have
set the `opacuserlogin <#opacuserlogin>`__ preference to 'Allow'. Once
logged in patrons are brought to their account summary. If you would
like to get to your account in the OPAC, you can click on your name in
the top right of any page in the OPAC.

`Resetting your password <#resetpwopac>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the `OpacResetPassword <#OpacResetPassword>`__ set to allow
patrons to reset their password they can click 'Forgot your password?'
link found under the log in box to reset their passwords.

'Forgot your password?' link
|image1002|

Once clicked they will be presented with a form asking for their
username and their email address (patrons must have an email address on
file to reset their password).Recover password

The system will then email the patron instructions for resetting their
password.Reset password confirmation

`My Summary <#opacmysummary>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My Summary
|image1003|

From the 'my summary' tab, patrons will see all of the items they have
checked out with the overdue items highlighted in red. If you have
`OpacRenewalAllowed <#OpacRenewalAllowed>`__ set to 'Allow' then your
patrons will be able to renew their books right from the OPAC. If you
have HTML entered in the `OPACMySummaryHTML <#OPACMySummaryHTML>`__
preference then you will see that to the right of the 'Fines' column.

Checked out tab with OPACMySummaryHTML set
|image1004|

If your patrons would like to see the items barcodes on their list of
checked out items you can set up a `patron
attribute <#patronattributetypes>`__ with the value of SHOW\_BCODE and
`authorized value <#authorizedvalues>`__ of YES\_NO.

Add SHOW\_BCODE patron attribute
|image1005|

Then on the `patron's record set the value <#editpatrons>`__ for
SHOW\_BCODE to yes.

Setting value for SHOW\_BCODE on patron record
|image1006|

This will add a column to the check out summary in the OPAC that shows
the patrons the barcodes of the items they have checked out.

`Guide to Searching <#searchguide>`__
-------------------------------------

This brief guide will explain a chart that shows a sample of how a
MARC21 database can be configured, as well as a brief introductory
searching guide. The indexing fields described in this document relate
to the bibliographic data and does not address authority database
indexing.

`Indexing and Searching Description <#searchguide-indexing>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Koha's databases are indexed by the Zebra open-source software. The
overview to the documentation describes Zebra as:

    "...Zebra is a high-performance, general-purpose structured text
    indexing and retrieval engine. It reads records in a variety of
    input formats (eg. email, XML, MARC) and provides access to them
    through a powerful combination of Boolean search expressions and
    relevance-ranked free-text queries.

    Zebra supports large databases (tens of millions of records, tens of
    gigabytes of data). It allows safe, incremental database updates on
    live systems. Because Zebra supports the industry-standard
    information retrieval protocol, Z39.50, you can search Zebra
    databases using an enormous variety of programs and toolkits, both
    commercial and free, which understands this protocol..." Zebra -
    User's Guide and Reference, p. 1,
    http://www.indexdata.dk/zebra/doc/zebra.pdf

This brief guide will explain a chart that shows a sample of how a
MARC21 database can be configured, as well as a brief introductory
searching guide. The indexing fields described in this document relate
to the bibliographic data and does not address authority database
indexing.

    **Note**

    The indexing described in this document is the set used by
    SouthEastern University. Your local indexing may vary.

`Indexing Configuration <#searchguide-indexconfig>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three configuration files that Koha uses while indexing.

The first configuration file (etc/zebradb/biblios/etc/bib1.att) contains
the Z39.50 bib-1 attribute list, plus the Koha local use attributes for
Biblio Indexes, Items Index, and Fixed Fields and other special indexes.
The Z39.50 Bib-1 profile is made up of several different types of
attributes: Use, Relation, Position, Structure, Truncation, and
Completeness. The bib-1 'Use' attribute is represented on the chart; the
other attributes are used primarily when doing searches. While there are
over 150+ use attributes that could be used to define your indexing set,
it's unlikely that you will choose to use them all. The attributes you
elect to use are those that become the indexing rules for your database.
The other five attribute sets define the various ways that a search can
be further defined, and will not specifically be addressed in this
document. For a complete list of the standard Bib-1 attributes, go to
http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html.

The second file is
etc/zebradb/marc\_defs/[marc21\|unimarc]/biblios/record.abs if you use
grs1 indexing [the default until 3.16] or
etc/zebradb/marc\_defs/[marc21\|unimarc]/biblios/biblio-koha-indexdefs.xml
if you use dom indexing [the default from 3.18]. Either files contains
the abstract syntax which maps the MARC21 tags to the set of Use
Attributes you choose to use. To be more precise the xml file to be
activate needs to be transform into biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl, read the
head of biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl to know more about this topic. The
rules established in this file provides a passable Bath level 0 and 1
service, which includes author, title, subject, keyword and exact
services such as standard identifiers (LCCN, ISBN, ISSN, etc.)

The third file (etc/zebradb/ccl.properties) is the Common Command
Language (CCL) field mappings. This file combines the bib-1 attribute
set file and the abstract file and adds the qualifiers, usually known as
index names. The qualifiers, or indexes, for this database are: pn, cpn,
cfn, ti, se, ut, nb, ns, sn, lcn, callnum, su, su-to, su-geo, su-ut,
yr,pubdate, acqdate, ln, pl, ab, nt, rtype, mc-rtype, mus, au, su-na,
kw, pb, ctype, and an.

The `Koha Indexing Chart <#kohasearchindexes>`__ summarizes the contents
of all three of these files in a more readable format. The first two
columns labeled Z39.50 attribute and Z39.50 name matches the Z39.50
bib-1 attributes file. The third column labeled MARC tags indexed is
where you find which MARC tags are mapped to an attribute. The fourth
column labeled Qualifiers identifies the search abbreviations used in
the internal CCL query. The following description provides a definition
for the word 'qualifiers'.

*Qualifiers are used to direct the search to a particular searchable
index, such as title (ti) and author indexes (au). The CCL standard
itself doesn't specify a particular set of qualifiers, but it does
suggest a few shorthand notations. You can customize the CCL parser to
support a particular set of qualifiers to reflect the current target
profile. Traditionally, a qualifier would map to a particular
use-attribute within the BIB-1attribute set. It is also possible to set
other attributes, such as the structure attribute.*

In the MARC tags indexed column, there are some conventions used that
have specific meanings. They are:

-  A three digit tag (100) means that all subfields in the tag can be
   used in a search query. So, if you enter a search for 'Jackson' as an
   author, you will retrieve records where Jackson could be the last
   name or the first name.

-  A three digit tag that has a '$' followed by a letter (600$a) means
   that a search query will only search the 'a' subfield.

-  A three digit tag that is followed by a ':' and a letter (240:w)
   means that a search query can be further qualified. The letter
   following the ':' identifies how to conduct the search. The most
   common values you'll see are 'w' (word), 'p' (phrase), 's' (sort),
   and 'n' (numeric).

The contents of the MARC tags, subfields, and/or fixed field elements
that are listed in this chart are all indexed. You'll see that every
attribute line is not mapped to a specific qualifier (index)-LC card
number, line 9 is one example. However, every indexed word (a string of
characters preceded and succeeded by a space) can be searched using a
keyword (kw) search. So, although an LC card number specific index
doesn't exist, you can still search by the LCCN since tag 010 is
assigned to the LC-card-number attribute. To verify this, enter 72180055
in the persistent search box. You should retrieve The gods themselves,
by Isaac Asimov.

Examples of fixed field elements indexing can be seen on the chart
between Attribute 8822 and Attribute 8703. These attributes are most
commonly used for limiting. The fixed field attributes currently
represent the BK codes. Other format codes, if needed, could be defined.

`Basic Searching <#searchguide-basics>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The search box that library staff and library patrons will see most
often is the persistent search box at the top of the page. Koha
interprets the searches as keyword searches.

Koha search box
|image1037|

To start a search, you enter a word or multiple words in the search box.
When a single word is entered, a keyword search is performed. You can
check this out by typing one word into the form and note the number of
results located. Then, repeat the search with a minor change. In front
of the search word, type 'kw=' followed by the same search term. The
results will be identical.

When you have more than one word in the search box, Koha will still do a
keyword search, but a bit differently. Each word will be searched on its
own, then the Boolean connector 'and' will narrow your search to those
items with all words contained in matching records.

Suppose you want to find material about how libraries are using mashups.
You'll select the major words and enter them into the persistent search
box.

Keyword Search
|image1038|

The response to this search is:

Results
|image1039|

The order of the words does not affect the retrieval results, so you
could also enter the search as "mashups library". The response to this
search is results

Results
|image1040|

Too many words in the search box will find very few matches, as the
following example illustrates:

No results found
|image1041|

`Advanced Searching <#searchguide-advanced>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you can't find the most appropriate material with a general search,
you can move to the Advanced Search page by clicking on the Search
option on the persistent toolbar.

Koha Menu
|image1042|

The Advanced Search page offers many ways to limit the results of your
search. You can search using the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT;
limit by item type; limit by year and language; limit by subtypes
audience, content, format, or additional content types; by location and
by availability.

The first limiting section on the Advanced Search page provides a quick
and simple way to use the Boolean operators in your search. Note that
this display depends on a system preference setting. This option can be
found on the Administration > System Preferences > Searching page. The
option called `expandedSearchOption <#expandedSearchOption>`__ must be
set to 'show' to see the following display.

Advanced Search Options
|image1043|

In this section you can choose among the many indexes by clicking on the
arrow in the first box. The blank box that follows is where you enter
your first search term or terms. On the second line, you can choose the
Boolean operator you want to use in your search. The options are 'and',
'or', and 'not'. Then, you would again choose the index to search,
followed by the second term or terms. If you have more concepts you want
to include in your search, you can click the [+] to add another line for
your search.

A sample search is shown next, followed by its results:

Advanced Search
|image1044|

Results from Advanced Search
|image1045|

When you use the Boolean operators to broaden or narrow a search,
remember the action of each operator. The 'and' operator narrows the
results you'll retrieve because the search will retrieve the records
that include all your search terms. The 'or' operator expands the
results because the search will look for occurrences of all of your
search terms. The 'not' operator excludes records with the term that
follows the operator.

Note: If you leave this `expandedSearchOption <#expandedSearchOption>`__
set to 'don't show', this is the display you will see:

Fewer Search Options
|image1046|

The Advanced Search page then shows the multiple kinds of limits that
can be applied to your search results. Either check a box or select from
the drop down menus to narrow your search. You will type the year, year
range, or a 'greater than (>)' or 'less than (<)' year.

Other Advanced Search Options
|image1047|

Finally, you can choose how the results will be sorted. The pre-defined
sort options are in the final area of the Advanced Search screen.

Sort Results By
|image1048|

The default sort is by relevance, although you can choose to sort by
author, by title, by call number, by dates, or by popularity (which uses
the information on total issues found in the items table). If you would
prefer a different default sort, you can set
`defaultSortField <#defaultSortField>`__ to one of the other choices in
Administration > System Preferences > Searching.

`Item Searching <#searchguide-itemsearch>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are looking for specific items you can use the item search engine
in the staff client to find them.

-  *Get there:* Search > Go to item search

At the top of the advanced search page in the staff client you will see
a link to 'Go to item search'Item search link

Clicking that link will open up a item specific search engine.Item
search

Using the search form that is presented you can find a list of specific
items that can be output to the screen or to a CSV file. If your results
are printed to the screen you will have the option to narrow your search
further using filters at the top.Item search results

`Common Command Language Searching <#searchguide-ccl>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Koha uses the Common Command Language (CCL) (ISO 8777) as its internal
search protocol. Searches initiated in the graphical interface use this
protocol as well, although the searcher doesn't know which indexes,
operators and limiters are available and being used to conduct their
search. The searcher can use the Advanced Search when more precise
results set are desired and where the search indexes are somewhat known.
However, some library users and many library staff prefer using a
command based structure. This part of the document will present and
explain the use of the Koha command based structure. The indexes,
operators, and limiters used are identical to those used in the
graphical interface.

`Indexes <#searchguide-indexes>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CCL standard itself doesn't specify a particular set of qualifiers
(indexes), but it does suggest a few short-hand notations such as 'ti',
'au', and 'su'. Koha has a default set of indexes; it's possible to
customize that set by adding needed indexes based on local requirements.
A qualifier (index) maps to a particular use-attribute within the Z39.50
BIB-1 attribute set. The complete Z39.50 Bib-1 Attribute can be viewed
at http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html.

The standard Koha set of indexes is a fairly common example of MARC21
indexing rules. The indexes that are defined in Koha are indexes
typically used by other integrated library systems. The defined Z39.50
Bib-1 Attribute mapped to the indexes include:

+--------------------------------+----------------------------+

`Search Syntax <#searchguide-syntax>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the persistent search box, single words generally retrieve large
sets. To narrow a search, you can use multiple words. Koha automatically
uses the 'and' Boolean operator to create a set of records matching your
input. When you want to narrow the search to an author or a title or a
subject or some other specific field or use a Boolean operator, there
isn't an obvious way to accomplish that specificity. The library user
can, of course, go to the Advanced Search page; however, if you know how
to construct a CCL search, you can achieve more specificity while using
the persistent search box on any page.

There is a specific order to the CCL search syntax. Although it can be
used for simple searches, it is an especially effective way to perform
complex searches, as it affords you a great deal of control over your
search results. To construct a CCL search, first enter a desired index
code, then an equal sign, followed by your search word(s). Following are
examples of simple CCL searches.

-  ti=principles of accounting

-  au=brown joseph

-  su=poetry

-  su-na=Shakespeare

-  kw=marlin

You can refine your search by combining search terms with Boolean
operators 'and', 'or', or 'not'. Following are examples of searches
using Boolean operators.

-  ti=principles of accounting and au=brown joseph

-  su=poetry not su-na=Shakespeare

-  kw=communication and su=debate

You can also choose to search for things that start with a character or
series of characters

-  ti,first-in-subfield=C (will show you all titles that start with the
   letter 'C')

Other string location searches can be performed with the following
keywords:

-  rtrn : right truncation

-  ltrn : left truncation

-  lrtrn : left and right truncation

-  st-date : type date

-  st-numeric : type number (integer)

-  ext : exact search on whole subfield (does not work with icu)

-  phr : search on phrase anywhere in the subfield

-  startswithnt : subfield starts with

Using specific indexes and Boolean operators are not the only way a
search can be refined. You can also refine your search as a phrase when
looking for a title, author, or subject. The syntax for this search is
*index,phr=search words*.

To illustrate the results of various search types, a search was done for
the words 'supreme court'. The results illustrate that the search index
and the word order make a difference in search results. Only the results
count and the search itself is in these examples. The search executed
will always be between the single quotes.

|image1057|

You can also choose to use limiters in your search query. Some common
limiters include dates, languages, record types, and item types. In the
Advance Search, you can either click a box or key in data to limit your
search. You can also apply the same limits with CCL by using the syntax
in the following examples. In all

*By Date: su=supreme court and yr,st-numeric=>2000*

Sample Search 10
|image1058|

When you limit by date, you can use the '>' (greater than), '<' (less
than), '=' (equal), or 'yyyy-yyyy' (range) symbols.

*By Item Type: su=nursing and itype:BK*

Sample Search 11
|image1059|

Each library will have a different set of item types defined in their
circulation configuration. When you set up item types, you define a code
and a name for each one. The name will appear on the Advance Search
page. The code you assigned is used as a CCL search limit, formatted as
'itype:x', where 'x' is the assigned code. The initial set of item types
in Koha will usually be edited to reflect your collections, so your item
type limiters may be different than the initial ones. The initial item
type limiters follow.

-  itype:BKS Books, Booklets, Workbooks

-  itype:SR Audio Cassettes, CDs

-  itype:IR Binders

-  itype:CF CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, General Online Resources

-  itype:VR DVDs, VHS

-  itype:KT Kit

-  itype:AR Models

-  itype:SER Serials

*By format: su=supreme court not l-format:sr*

Sample Search 12
|image1060|

The format limiters are derived from a combination of LDR, 006 and 007
positions. The formats that are currently defined are the following.

-  l-format:ta Regular print

-  l-format:tb Large print

-  l-format:fk Braille

-  l-format:sd CD audio

-  l-format:ss Cassette recording

-  l-format:vf VHS tape

-  l-format:vd DVD video

-  l-format:co CD software

-  l-format:cr Website

*By content type: su=supreme court not ctype:l*

Sample Search 13
|image1061|

The content types are taken from the 008 MARC tag, positions 24-27.

There are two other limiter types that are not described in this
document. They are: Audience and Content. The only difference in the
syntax of the CCL is the actual limiter. They are reproduced here just
in case you would like to use these limiters.

`Koha Search Indexes <#kohasearchindexes>`__

By default, not all fields are indexed in the Zebra search engine, but
many are. Below are the MARC21 fields that are indexed in Zebra.

Table: Indexes

Plugin System
=============

Koha's Plugin System allows for you to add additional tools and reports
to Koha that are specific to your library. Plugins are installed by
uploading KPZ ( Koha Plugin Zip ) packages. A KPZ file is just a zip
file containing the perl files, template files, and any other files
necessary to make the plugin work.

The plugin system needs to be turned on by a system administrator.

`Set up <#pluginsetup>`__
-------------------------

To set up the Koha plugin system you must first make some changes to
your install.

-  Change <enable\_plugins>0</enable\_plugins> to
   <enable\_plugins>1</enable\_plugins> in your koha-conf.xml file

-  Restart your webserver

Once set up is complete you will need to alter your
`UseKohaPlugins <#UseKohaPlugins>`__ system preference. On the Tools
page you will see the Tools Plugins and on the Reports page you will see
the Reports Plugins.

Search History
==============

If you have your `EnableSearchHistory <#EnableSearchHistory>`__
preference set to keep your search history then you can access this
information by clicking on your username in the top right of the staff
client and choosing 'Search history'.

Search history
|image1062|

From this page you will see your bibliographic search history

Bibliographic search history
|image1063|

And your authority search history.

About Koha
==========

The 'About Koha' area will give you important server information as well
as general information about Koha.

-  *Get there:* More > About Koha

`Server Information <#aboutserver>`__
-------------------------------------

Under the 'Server Information' tab you will find information about the
Koha version and the machine you have installed Koha on. This
information is very important for debugging problems. When reporting
issues to your support provider or to the various other support avenues
(mailing lists, chat room, etc), it's always good to give the
information from this screen.

Server Information on Koha
|image1065|

`Perl Modules <#aboutserverperl>`__
-----------------------------------

In order to take advantage of all of the functionalities of Koha, you
will need to keep your Perl modules up to date. The 'Perl Modules' tab
will show you all of the modules required by Koha, the version you have
installed and whether you need to upgrade certain modules.

Perl Modules
|image1066|

Items listed in bold are required by Koha, items highlighed in red are
missing completely and items highlighted in yellow simply need to be
upgraded.

`System Information <#aboutsystem>`__
-------------------------------------

This tab will provide you with warnings if you are using system
preferences that have since been deprecated or system preferences that
you have set without other required preferences

Implementation Checklist
========================

The following guide will walk you through the areas of Koha you need to
look at in order to prepare to start using the system.

`Data Migration <#imp-migration>`__
-----------------------------------

Before you can start using Koha you'll need to have some data. This can
be done by entering it all by hand, but most people already have their
data in electronic format of some sort and just need to reformat it a
bit for importing into Koha.

-  Create a list of libraries and enter their info and codes into
   `Libraries & Groups <#libsgroups>`__

-  Define your list of `Item Types <#itemtypeadmin>`__

-  Define your patron categories and enter the categories and their
   codes into `Patron Categories <#patcats>`__

-  Enter any additional patron information fields you use in your
   library in the `Patron Attributes <#patronattributetypes>`__

   -  Requires that you first set the
      `ExtendedPatronAttributes <#ExtendedPatronAttributes>`__ system
      preference if you have custom fields

-  Define all of your `Authorized Values <#authorizedvalues>`__

   -  `Collection codes <#ccode>`__

   -  `Shelving locations <#shelvelocvals>`__

   -  Item statuses (`lost <#lost>`__, `not for loan <#notforloan>`__,
      `damaged <#damageauth>`__, `withdrawn <#withdrawnauth>`__)

   -  Plus any others that are needed in your library

-  Optionally define `City/State/Postal Code <#citytowns>`__ combos

-  `Map your bibliographic data <#kohamarcmapping>`__ from your legacy
   system to Koha fields and migrate (remembering to use the collection,
   shelving, item type and library codes you entered in the above
   setting areas)

-  `Map your patron data <#patronimport>`__ from your legacy system to
   the Koha fields and migrate (remembering to use the patron and
   library codes you defined above)

-  Test your migrated data to be sure that everything is as you expect
   it to be, some things to test include:

   -  Check some of your titles with diacritics and make sure that they
      migrated properly.

   -  Check titles in a series and make sure that series information
      migrated properly.

   -  Make sure that your patrons have their contact information in the
      right fields.

   -  If your serials data was migrated search for these records in the
      catalog and confirm that they look right.

   -  If your serials data was migrated search for these records in the
      serials module and confirm that they look right.

   -  Check marc records to verify a variety of items are cataloged
      correctly

   -  Check cataloging process to see if all necessary fields are
      available

   -  If fines are migrated, check to see that they are applied
      correctly

   -  If holds are migrated, check to see they are accurate in catalog
      and patron record

`Admin Configuration <#impadmin>`__
-----------------------------------

Most of these preferences won't need to be changed to use your Koha

   -  Decide when the system `checks URLs in catalog
      records <#checkurlcron>`__ to see if they are still valid

`Authorities Configuration <#impauthorities>`__
-----------------------------------------------

Koha has the ability to keep track of your authority records and how
they're linked to your bibliographic records. Before using authorities
you should configure several preferences.

-  Set `Authority Frameworks <#authoritiesadmin>`__ aka templates

-  Authority System Preferences

   -  `BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__ : Decide if
      Koha creates authorities when cataloging

   -  `dontmerge <#dontmerge>`__ : Decide if updates to authorities
      trigger updates to the bibliographic records that link to them

   -  `AutoCreateAuthorities <#AutoCreateAuthorities>`__ : Decide when
      authorities are created

   -  `LinkerModule <#LinkerModule>`__ : Decide which match the
      authority linker should use

      linking to be broader or more specific

   -  `CatalogModuleRelink <#CatalogModuleRelink>`__ : Decide if you
      want to enable authority linking while cataloging

-  Set up your `cron jobs <#cronjobs>`__

   -  Choose when the system looks for authorities updates to `merge
      changes into bibliographic records <#mergeauthcron>`__

`Searching Configuration <#impsearching>`__
-------------------------------------------

There are several system preferences related to searching, it is not
always recommended to make too many changes to these preferences since
they are set to get you the most relevant results. If you would like to
change the default way that Koha handles searching, view the `Searching
system preferences <#searchingprefs>`__ tab.

-  Set up your `cron jobs <#cronjobs>`__

   -  Decide how often your `system rebuilds the search
      index <#rebuildsearchcron>`__ (4-10 min)

SOPAC2 Installation
===================

`Introduction <#sopacintro>`__
------------------------------

This is an installation guide for SOPAC2 and its Koha connector. It has
been tested on Debian Lenny and Ubuntu Jaunty with Drupal 6.12 and Koha
3.0.x. It does not cover the installation of Koha and Drupal, only
SOPAC, its dependencies and the connector.

`Installation of Locum and Insurge <#sopacinstall>`__
-----------------------------------------------------

Locum and Insurge are the two libraries used primarily by SOPAC. They
serve as a layer of abstraction to the data. Insurge manages the social
aspect (tags, reviews, ratings), while Locum manages the connection to
the ILS via the connector. Both libraries use a different database from
that of Drupal.

`Dependencies <#sopacdepend>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no packages for Debian MDB2 yet, you can install it via pear:

::

    # apt-get install php-pear
    # pear install MDB2
    # pear install MDB2#mysql

`Download <#sopacdownload>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the Locum and Insurge libraries from SVN:

::

    # cd /usr/local/lib
    # svn co http://dobby.darienlibrary.org/svn/locum/trunk/ locum
    # svn co http://dobby.darienlibrary.org/svn/insurge/trunk/ insurge

`Creation of the Database <#sopaccreatedb>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ mysql -u root
    mysql> create database scas;
    mysql> grant all privileges on scas.* to scas_user@'localhost' identified by 'scas_pass';
    mysql> flush privileges;
    mysql> exit

`Sync DSN <#sopacdsn>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file will provide the connection information to a DB libraries:

::

    # nano /usr/local/etc/locum_insurge_dsn.php

It should contain:

::

    <?php
    $dsn = 'mysql://scas_user:scas_pass@localhost/scas';

`Installation of Insurge <#sopacinstallinsurge>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you customize the name of the database, remember to edit the sql
file:

::

    # nano /usr/local/lib/insurge/sql/scas_insurge.sql

Import Insurge:

::

    $ mysql -u root -p < /usr/local/lib/insurge/sql/scas_insurge.sql

Configure Insurge:

::

    # nano /usr/local/lib/insurge/config/insurge.ini

The variables in insurge.ini are empty. The default values are too long
and cause MySQL errors.

Here is a sample of insurge.ini

::

    ; This is the Locum configuration file
    ; General configuration options for your installation of Insurge.
    [insurge_config]
    dsn_file = "/usr/local/etc/locum_insurge_dsn.php"
    ; This is where you configure your repository membership information.
    ;
    ; parent_server is the server name of the repository parent server you have been
    ; told to use.
    ; group_id = The group ID you have been given by your repository admin.
    ; These configuration points are OPTIONAL and are only necessary if you are
    ; participating in a repository relationship.
    [repository_info]
    parent_server = ""
    group_id = ""
    group_key = ""

`Installation of Locum <#sopacinstallocum>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same procedure applies to Locum

::

    # nano /usr/local/lib/locum/sql/scas_locum.sql
    # mysql < /usr/local/lib/locum/sql/scas_locum.sql
    # nano /usr/local/lib/locum/sql/locum_init.sql
    # mysql < /usr/local/lib/locum/sql/locum_init.sql
    # nano /usr/local/lib/locum/config/locum.ini
    # mkdir /usr/local/var
    # mkdir /usr/local/var/log

Configure the DSN:

::

    [locum_config]
    dsn_file = "/usr/local/etc/locum_insurge_dsn.php"

And the information for your Koha installation:

::

    [ils_config]
    ils = "koha";
    ils_version = "30x"
    ils_server = "localhost"
    ils_harvest_port = "80"

The rest depends on your Koha configuration.

`Installation of Koha Connector <#sopackoha>`__
-----------------------------------------------

Download the Koha connector using SVN:

::

    # cd /usr/local/lib/locum/connectors/
    # svn co http://dobby.darienlibrary.org/svn/connectors/koha/ locum_koha_30x

`Harvest Records <#sopacharvest>`__
-----------------------------------

Now that the connector is in place, we will be able to launch
harvest.php, a tool that will reap Locum DB Koha and fill the locum.

Start by configuring harvest.php:

::

    # nano /usr/local/lib/locum/tools/harvest.php

Here are the variables you must change:

::

    $first_record = 1;
    $last_record = 30;

These are the minimum and maximum biblionumbers from your Koha install.

Then start the harvest:

::

    # chmod +x /usr/local/lib/locum/tools/harvest.php
    $ /usr/local/lib/locum/tools/harvest.php

`Installation of Sphinx <#sopacphinx>`__
----------------------------------------

Sphinx is the indexer for the database used by Locum and Insurge.

`Dependencies <#sphinxdepend>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no Debian package for Sphinx so you'll have to compile the
source directly:

::

    # apt-get install g++ make libmysql++-dev

`Download and Compile <#sphinxdownload>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ wget http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads/sphinx-0.9.8.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf sphinx-0.9.8.tar.gz
    $ cd sphinx-0.9.8
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/sphinx
    $ make
    # make install
    # mkdir /usr/local/sphinx
    # mkdir /usr/local/sphinx/lib
    # cp api/sphinxapi.php /usr/local/sphinx/lib/
    $ rm -R sphinx-0.9.8*

`Creation of User and Group <#sphinxuser>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a Sphinx user and change the owner:

::

    # adduser sphinx
    # addgroup sphinx
    # usermod -G sphinx sphinx
    # mkdir /usr/local/sphinx/var/run
    # chown -R sphinx.sphinx /usr/local/sphinx/var

`The Sphinx daemon <#demonsphinx>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download:

::

    # cd /etc/init.d
    # wget http://www.thesocialopac.net/sites/thesocialopac.net/files/sphinx
    # chmod +x /etc/init.d/sphinx

Add Sphinx to the default boot services:

::

    # update-rc.d sphinx defaults

`Configuration <#sphinxconfig>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the configuration file supplied with the source of Sphinx before
the change:

::

    # cp /usr/local/lib/locum/sphinx/sphinx.conf /usr/local/sphinx/etc/
    # sed 's/locum_db_user/scas_user/g' /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf > tmpfile;
    mv tmpfile /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf
    # sed 's/locum_db_pass/scas_pass/g' /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf > tmpfile; mv tmpfile /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf

And if you personalize the name of the database:

::

    # sed 's/scas/MY_DB/g' /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf > tmpfile; mv tmpfile /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf

`Indexing documents <#sphinxindexing>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indexing is necessary if you want to use the search features of SOPAC.

You must first complete the Insurge table index

::

    # chmod +x /usr/local/lib/insurge/tools/update-index.php
    $ /usr/local/lib/insurge/tools/update-index.php

Then start indexing Sphinx

::

    $ /usr/local/sphinx/bin/indexer --all

Finally, we must start the daemon:

::

    # /etc/init.d/sphinx start

When the daemon is running, you can update the index with:

::

    $ /usr/local/sphinx/bin/indexer --all --rotate

`Installation of SOPAC2 <#installsopac>`__
------------------------------------------

Now to the SOPAC software itself:

`Download <#downloadsopac>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download from SVN:

::

    $ cd /chemin/vers/drupal/sites/all/
    $ mkdir modules
    $ cd modules/
    $ svn co http://dobby.darienlibrary.org/svn/sopac/trunk/ sopac

`Installation <#sopacinstallation>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Drupal's administration settings, activate the module. Also, enable
the dependencies:

-  Profile

-  PHP Filter

-  Path

The Drupal menu should now list these entries.

`Configuration <#configsopac>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then go into the settings of SOPAC.

-  Configure the paths to the Locum and Insurge libraries

-  Choose a URL prefix SOPAC, in my "catalog". Create a node with
   content like:

::

    <?php
    print sopac_search_form('both');
    print theme('pages_catalog');

-  Check the Input Format "PHP Code"

-  Check Move to front page

-  In URL path settings, set the SOPAC URL prefix you have chosen.

Go to the root of Drupal, a search form will appear.

Remember to empty Drupal's cache when something does not work.

Drupal offers a few blocks, which are not configured by default. You
must specify on which page they should appear.

Cron Jobs
=========

A cron job is a Linux command for scheduling a command or script on your
server to complete repetitive tasks automatically. Scripts executed as a
cron job are typically used to modify files or databases; however, they
can perform other tasks that do not modify data on the server, like
sending out email notifications. Koha has many cron jobs in place that
you can enable (search engine indexing, overdue notice generation, data
cleanup and more), this chapter will explain those for you.

`Cron Jobs <#cronjobs>`__
-------------------------

The locations below assume a dev install which puts the crons in misc/,
if you have a standard install you may want to look in bin/ for these
files if you cannot find them in misc/

`Search <#searchcron>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Rebuild Index <#rebuildsearchcron>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script path: misc/migration\_tools/rebuild\_zebra.pl

Does: Updates Zebra indexes with recently changed data.

Required by: Zebra

Frequency suggestion: every x minutes, (between 5-15 minutes) depending
on performance needs

`Circulation <#circcron>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Holds Queue <#buildholdscron>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script path: misc/cronjobs/holds/build\_holds\_queue.pl

Does: Updates holds queue report

Required by: `Holds Queue Report <#holdsqueue>`__

Frequency suggestion: every 1-4 hours

Description:

-  A script that should be run periodically if your library system
   allows borrowers to place on-shelf holds. This script decides which
   library should be responsible for fulfilling a given hold request.

   It's behavior is controlled by the system preferences
   `StaticHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__ and
   `RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__.

   If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the
   on-shelf holds fulfillment process, you should list the the libraries
   that \*do\* participate in the process here by inputting all the
   participating library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g.
   "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc. ).

   By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system
   will first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the
   pickup library if possible. If there are no items available at the
   pickup library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use
   the list of libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled ( which it is by default ), the
   script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
   placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

   For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
   small, medium and large ) and you want the burden of holds
   fulfillment to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you
   would want StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like
   "LRG,MED,SML".

   If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
   throughout your library system, simply enable
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight. When this system preference is enabled,
   the order in which libraries will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf
   hold will be randomized each time the list is regenerated.

   Leaving StaticHoldsQueueWeight empty is contraindicated at this time.
   Doing so will cause the build\_holds\_queue script to ignore
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight, causing the script to request hold
   fulfillment not randomly, but by alphabetical order.

Execute without options for help.

**DESCRIPTION**

--lost \| -l

This option takes the form of n=lv, where n is num days overdue, and lv
is the lost value. See warning below.

--charge \| -c

This specifies what lost value triggers Koha to charge the account for
the lost item. Replacement costs are not charged if this is not
specified.

--verbose \| v

verbose.

--confirm

confirm. without this option, the script will report the number of
affected items and return without modifying any records.

--quiet

**NAME**

update\_totalissues.pl

**SYNOPSIS**

update\_totalissues.pl --use-stats

update\_totalissues.pl --use-items

update\_totalissues.pl --commit=1000

update\_totalissues.pl --since='2012-01-01'

update\_totalissues.pl --interval=30d

**DESCRIPTION**

This batch job populates bibliographic records' total issues count based
on historical issue statistics.

--help Prints this help

-v\|--verbose

Provide verbose log information (list every bib modified).

--use-stats

Use the data in the statistics table for populating total issues.

--use-items

Use items.issues data for populating total issues. Note that issues data
from the items table does not respect the --since or --interval options,
by definition. Also note that if both --use-stats and --use-items are
specified, the count of biblios processed will be misleading.

-s\|--since=DATE

Only process issues recorded in the statistics table since DATE.

-i\|--interval=S

Only process issues recorded in the statistics table in the last N units
of time. The interval should consist of a number with a one- letter unit
suffix. The valid suffixes are h (hours), d (days), w (weeks), m
(months), and y (years). The default unit is days.

--incremental

Add the number of issues found in the statistics table to the existing
total issues count. Intended so that this script can be used as a cron
job to update popularity information during low-usage periods. If
neither --since or --interval are specified, incremental mode will
default to processing the last twenty-four hours.

--commit=N

Commit the results to the database after every N records are processed.

--test

Only test the popularity population script.

**WARNING**

If the time on your database server does not match the time on your Koha
server you will need to take that into account, and probably use the
--since argument instead of the --interval argument for incremental
updating.

overdue\_notices.pl - prepare messages to be sent to patrons for overdue
items

**SYNOPSIS**

overdue\_notices.pl [ -n ] [ -library <branchcode> ] [ -library
<branchcode>...] [ -max <number of days> ] [ -csv [ <filename> ] ]
[-itemscontent <field list> ]

Options:

-help brief help message

-man full documentation

-n No email will be sent

-max <days> maximum days overdue to deal with

-library <branchname> only deal with overdues from this library
(repeatable : several libraries can be given)

-csv <filename> populate CSV file

-html <filename> Output html to file

-itemscontent <list of fields> item information in templates

-borcat <categorycode> category code that must be included

-borcatout <categorycode> category code that must be excluded

**OPTIONS**

-help Print a brief help message and exits.

-man Prints the manual page and exits.

-v Verbose. Without this flag set, only fatal errors are reported.

-n Do not send any email. Overdue notices that would have been sent to
the patrons or to the admin are printed to standard out. CSV data (if
the -csv flag is set) is written to standard out or to any csv filename
given.

-max Items older than max days are assumed to be handled somewhere else,
probably the longoverdues.pl script. They are therefore ignored by this
program. No notices are sent for them, and they are not added to any CSV
files. Defaults to 90 to match longoverdues.pl.

-library

select overdues for one specific library. Use the value in the
branches.branchcode table. This option can be repeated in order to
select overdues for a group of libraries.

-csv Produces CSV data. if -n (no mail) flag is set, then this CSV data
is sent to standard out or to a filename if provided. Otherwise, only
overdues that could not be emailed are sent in CSV format to the admin.

-itemscontent

comma separated list of fields that get substituted into templates in
places of the <<items.content>> placeholder. This defaults to
issuedate,title,barcode,author

Other possible values come from fields in the biblios, items, and issues
tables.

-borcat Repetable field, that permit to select only few of patrons
categories.

-borcatout

Repetable field, permis to exclude some patrons categories.

-t \| --triggered

This option causes a notice to be generated if and only if an item is
overdue by the number of days defined in a notice trigger.

By default, a notice is sent each time the script runs, which is
suitable for less frequent run cron script, but requires syncing notice
triggers with the cron schedule to ensure proper behavior. Add the
--triggered option for daily cron, at the risk of no notice being
generated if the cron fails to run on time.

-list-all

Default items.content lists only those items that fall in the range of
the currently processing notice. Choose list-all to include all overdue
items in the list (limited by -max setting).

**DESCRIPTION**

This script is designed to alert patrons and administrators of overdue
items.

Configuration

This script pays attention to the overdue notice configuration performed
in the "Overdue notice/status triggers" section of the "Tools" area of
the staff interface to Koha. There, you can choose which letter
templates are sent out after a configurable number of days to patrons of
each library. More information about the use of this section of Koha is
available in the Koha manual.

The templates used to craft the emails are defined in the "Tools:
Notices" section of the staff interface to Koha.

Outgoing emails

Typically, messages are prepared for each patron with overdue items.
Messages for whom there is no email address on file are collected and
sent as attachments in a single email to each library administrator, or
if that is not set, then to the email address in the
"KohaAdminEmailAddress" system preference.

These emails are staged in the outgoing message queue, as are messages
produced by other features of Koha. This message queue must be processed
regularly by the misc/cronjobs/process\_message\_queue.pl program.

In the event that the "-n" flag is passed to this program, no emails are
sent. Instead, messages are sent on standard output from this program.
They may be redirected to a file if desired.

Templates

Templates can contain variables enclosed in double angle brackets like
<<this>>. Those variables will be replaced with values specific to the
overdue items or relevant patron. Available variables are:

<<bib>>

the name of the library

<<items.content>>

one line for each item, each line containing a tab separated list of
title, author, barcode, issuedate

<<borrowers.\*>>

any field from the borrowers table

<<branches.\*>>

any field from the branches table

CSV output

The "-csv" command line option lets you specify a file to which overdues
data should be output in CSV format.

With the "-n" flag set, data about all overdues is written to the file.
Without that flag, only information about overdues that were unable to
be sent directly to the patrons will be written. In other words, this
CSV file replaces the data that is typically sent to the administrator
email address.

**USAGE EXAMPLES**

"overdue\_notices.pl" - In this most basic usage, with no command line
arguments, all libraries are processed individually, and notices are
prepared for all patrons with overdue items for whom we have email
addresses. Messages for those patrons for whom we have no email address
are sent in a single attachment to the library administrator's email
address, or to the address in the KohaAdminEmailAddress system
preference.

"overdue\_notices.pl -n -csv /tmp/overdues.csv" - sends no email and
populates /tmp/overdues.csv with information about all overdue items.

"overdue\_notices.pl -library MAIN max 14" - prepare notices of overdues
in the last 2 weeks for the MAIN library.

**SEE ALSO**

The misc/cronjobs/advance\_notices.pl program allows you to send
messages to patrons in advance of their items becoming due, or to alert
them of items that have just become due.

**INTERNAL METHODS**

These methods are internal to the operation of overdue\_notices.pl.

parse\_letter

parses the letter template, replacing the placeholders with data
specific to this patron, biblio, or item

named parameters:

letter - required hashref

borrowernumber - required integer

substitute - optional hashref of other key/value pairs that should be
substituted in the letter content

returns the "letter" hashref, with the content updated to reflect the
substituted keys and values.

prepare\_letter\_for\_printing

returns a string of text appropriate for printing in the event that an
overdue notice will not be sent to the patron's email address. Depending
on the desired output format, this may be a CSV string, or a
human-readable representation of the notice.

**NAME**

cloud-kw.pl - Creates HTML keywords clouds from Koha Zebra Indexes

**USAGE**

cloud-kw.pl [--verbose\|--help] --conf=cloud.conf

Creates multiple HTML files containing keywords cloud with top terms
sorted by their logarithmic weight. cloud.conf is a YAML configuration
file driving cloud generation process.

**PARAMETERS**

--conf=configuration file

Specify configuration file name

--verbose\|-v

Enable script verbose mode.

--help\|-h

Print this help page.

**CONFIGURATION**

Configuration file looks like that:

::

      ---
             # Koha configuration file for a specific installation
             # If not present, defaults to KOHA_CONF
             KohaConf: /home/koha/mylibray/etc/koha-conf.xml
             # Zebra index to scan
             ZebraIndex: Author
             # Koha index used to link found kewords with an opac search URL
             KohaIndex: au
             # Number of top keyword to use for the cloud
             Count: 50
             # Include CSS style directives with the cloud
             # This could be used as a model and then CSS directives are
             # put in the appropriate CSS file directly.
             Withcss: Yes
             # HTML file where to output the cloud
             Output: /home/koha/mylibrary/koharoot/koha-tmpl/cloud-author.html
            ---
             KohaConf: /home/koha/yourlibray/etc/koha-conf.xml
             ZebraIndex: Subject
             KohaIndex: su
             Count: 200
             Withcss: no
             Output: /home/koha/yourlibrary/koharoot/koha-tmpl/cloud-subject.html

**IMPROVEMENTS**

Generated top terms have more informations than those outputted from the
time being. Some parameters could be easily added to improve this
script:

WithCount

In order to output terms with the number of occurrences they have been
found in Koha Catalogue by Zebra.

CloudLevels

Number of levels in the cloud. Now 24 levels are hardcoded.

Weighting

Weighting method used to distribute terms in the cloud. We could have
two values: Logarithmic and Linear. Now it's Logarithmic by default.

Order

Now terms are outputted in the lexical order. They could be sorted by
their weight.

`Share Usage Stats <#usagecron>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script path: misc/cronjobs/share\_usage\_with\_koha\_community.pl

Does: If you're sharing information via the `UsageStats <#UsageStats>`__
feature this will send your info to the `Hea
website <http://hea.koha-community.org/>`__.

Frequency: monthly

`Perl Documentation <#usagecronperl>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**NAME**

share\_usage\_with\_koha\_community.pl - Share your library's usage with
the Koha community

**SYNOPSIS**

share\_usage\_with\_koha\_community.pl [-h\|--help] [-v\|--verbose]

If the `UsageStats <#UsageStats>`__ system preference is set, you can
launch this script to share your usage data anonymously with the Koha
community.

Collecting Koha usage statistics will help developers to know how Koha
is used across the world.

This script will send the usage data for the bibliographic and authority
records, checkouts, holds, orders, and subscriptions.

Only the total number is retrieved. In no case will private data be
shared!

In order to know which parts of Koha modules are used, this script will
collect some system preference values.

If you want to tell us who you are, you can fill the
`UsageStatsLibraryName <#UsageStatsLibraryName>`__ system preference
with your library name,
`UsageStatsLibraryUrl <#UsageStatsLibraryUrl>`__,
`UsageStatsLibraryType <#UsageStatsLibraryType>`__ and/or
`UsageStatsCountry <#UsageStatsCountry>`__.

All these data will be analyzed on the http://hea.koha-community.org
Koha community website.

IMPORTANT : please do NOT run the cron on the 1st, but on another day.
The idea is to avoid all Koha libraries sending their data at the same
time ! So choose any day between 1 and 28 !

**OPTIONS**

-h\|--help

Print a brief help message

-v\|--verbose

Verbose mode.

-f\|--force

Force the update.

`OAI-PMH <#OAI-PMHservice>`__
-----------------------------

For the Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
(OAI-PMH) there are two groups of 'participants': Data Providers and
Service Providers. Data Providers (open archives, repositories) provide
free access to metadata, and may, but do not necessarily, offer free
access to full texts or other resources. OAI-PMH provides an easy to
implement, low barrier solution for Data Providers. Service Providers
use the OAI interfaces of the Data Providers to harvest and store
metadata. Note that this means that there are no live search requests to
the Data Providers; rather, services are based on the harvested data via
OAI-PMH.

Koha at present can only act as a Data Provider. It can not harvest from
other repositories. The biggest stumbling block to having Koha harvest
from other repositories is that MARC is the only metadata format that
Koha indexes natively. Visit
http://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/english/page3.htm for diagrams of how
OAI-PMH works.

Learn more about OAI-PMH at: http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/

To enable OAI-PMH in Koha edit the `OAI-PMH <#OAI-PMH>`__ preference.
Once enabled you can visit http://YOURKOHACATALOG/cgi-bin/koha/oai.pl to
see your file.

`REST services <#Rest-services>`__
----------------------------------

Koha can now be requested by REST http requests. BibLibre wrotes an
external module to adds more possibilities than ILS-DI can provide.There
is no authentication process, but authorized ips are listed in the
config file. Services have been tested in 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14 koha
versions. You can find more information about it into README file and
opac/rest.pl documentation on http://git.biblibre.com. If you want to
add features, send us a patch at dev\_patches AT biblibre DOT com.

Services provided in 1.4 version are:

Using the SRU server
====================

`Using the SRU server <#usingsru>`__
------------------------------------

Koha implements the Search/Retrieve via URL (SRU) protocol. More
information about the protocol itself can be found at
http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/. The version implemented is version
1.1.

`Explain <#sru_explain>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to have information about the implementation of SRU on a
given server, you should have access to the Explain file using a request
to the server without any parameter. Like
<http://myserver.com:9999/biblios/>. The response from the server is an
XML file that should look like the following and will give you
information about the default settings of the SRU server.

::

                        <zs:version>1.1</zs:version>

`Search <#sru_search>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This url :
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=reefs
is composed of the following elements:

-  base url of the SRU server : http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?

-  search part with the 3 required parameters : version, operation and
   query. The parameters within the search part should be of the
   key=value form, and can be combined with the & character.

One can add optional parameters to the query, for instance
maximumRecords indicating the maximum number of records to be returned
by the server. So
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=reefs&maximumRecords=5
will only get the first 5 results results from the server.

http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/sru1-1archive/search-retrieve-operation.html
gives more details about the search operations and in particular the
list of optional parameters for searching.

`More details about Search <#sru_search_more_details>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "operation" key can take two values: scan or searchRetrieve.

If operation=searchRetrieve, then the search key should be query. As in
: operation=searchRetrieve&query=reefs

If operation=scan, then the search key should be scanClause. As in :
operation=scan&scanClause=reefs

etc/zebradb/biblios/etc/bib1.att defines Zebra/3950 indexes that exist
on your system. For instance you'll see that we have indexes for Subject
and for Title: att 21 Subject and att 4 Title respectively.

In the pqf.properties file located under etc/zebradb/pqf.properties I
see that an access point already uses my Subject index (index.dc.subject
= 1=21) while another uses my Title index (index.dc.title = 1=4) I know
this is my Subject index because as I've seen just before in my bib1.att
file, it's called with =1=21 in Z3950: so index.dc.subject = 1=21
correctly points to my Subject index. And Title was called with 1=4 so
index.dc.title = 1=4 correctly points to my Title index. I can now
construct my query just like I would in a search box, just preceding it
with the "query" key: query=Subject=reefs and Title=coral searches
"reefs" in the subject and "coral" in the title. The full url would be
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=Subject=reefs
and Title=coral If I want to limit the result set to just 5 records, I
can do
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=Subject=reefs
and Title=coral&maximumRecords=5

I can also play with truncate, relations, etc. Those are also defined in
my pqf.properties file. I can see for instance the position properties
defined as:

::

                   position.first              = 3=1 6=1
                  # "first in field"
                   position.any                = 3=3 6=1
                     # "any position in field"


So as an example if I want "coral" to be at the beginning of the title,
I can do this query :
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=Title=coral
first

New titles slider for OPAC
==========================

Often times libraries will want to add a flowing widget with new
materials at the library to their main public catalog page. To do this
you can use a widget from any number of services (usually for a cost) or
you can `enable plugins <#pluginsystem>`__ in Koha and use the `Cover
Flow
plugin <http://git.bywatersolutions.com/koha-plugins.git/shortlog/refs/heads/cover_flow>`__
which is based on the
`Flipster <https://github.com/drien/jquery-flipster>`__, a responsive
jQuery coverflow plugin.

Once the plugin is installed, the steps to get your coverflow to show up
are as follows:

First, you need to create one or more public reports for your coverflow
widget or widgets to be based on. This is how the plugin knows what the
content of your widget should contain. Each report needs only three
columns; title, biblionumber, and isbn. It is important that you have a
good and valid isbn, as that is the datum used to actually fetch the
cover. In the iteration of the plugin, we are using Amazon cover images,
but I believe in the end I will make the cover image fetcher
configurable so we can use any data source for cover image fetching.

Second, we need to configure the plugin. The plugin configuration is a
single text area that uses YAML ( actually, it’s JSON, whcih is a subset
of YAML ) to store the configuration options. In this example it looks
like this:

::

    - id: 42
      selector: #coverflow
      options:
      style: coverflow

In this example, we are telling the plugin to use the report with id 42,
and use it to create a coverflow widget to replace the HTML element with
the id “coverflow”. The options list is passed directly to Flipster, so
any options supported by Flipster can be set from the plugin
configuration! In fact, in addition to the traditional coverflow,
Flipster has a “carousel” mode which is a much more compact version of
the coverflow. You can also configure which cover the widget will start
on, among other options.

At the time the plugins options are saved or updated, the plugin will
then generate some minified JavaScript code that is automatically stored
in the Koha system preference OPACUserJS. Here is an example of the
output:

::

    /* JS for Koha CoverFlow Plugin
     This JS was added automatically by installing the CoverFlow plugin
     Please do not modify */$(document).ready(function(){$.getScript("/plugin/Koha/Plugin/Com/ByWaterSolutions/CoverFlow/jquery-flipster/src/js/jquery.flipster.min.js",function(data,textStatus,jqxhr){$("head").append("<link id='flipster-css' href='/plugin/Koha/Plugin/Com/ByWaterSolutions/CoverFlow/jquery-flipster/src/css/jquery.flipster.min.css' type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' />");$('#coverflow').load("/coverflow.pl?id=42",function(){var opt={'items':'.item','minfactor':15,'distribution':1.5,'scalethreshold':0,'staticbelowthreshold':false,'titleclass':'itemTitle','selectedclass':'selectedItem','scrollactive':true,'step':{'limit':4,'width':10,'scale':true}};$('#coverflow').flipster({style:'coverflow',});});});});
    /* End of JS for Koha CoverFlow Plugin */

Why do this? For speed! Rather than regenerating this code each and
every time the page loads, we can generate it once, and use it over and
over again.

If you inspect the code closely, you’ll notice it references a script
“coverflow.pl”. This is a script that is included with the coverflow
plugin. Since we need to access this from the OPAC ( and we don’t want
to set off any XSS attack alarms ), we need to modify the web server
configuration for the public catalog and add the followup to it:

::

    ScriptAlias /coverflow.pl "/var/lib/koha/mykoha/plugins/Koha/Plugin/Com/ByWaterSolutions/CoverFlow/coverflow.pl"

This line gives us access to the coverflow.pl script from the OPAC. This
script retrieves the report data and passes it back to the public
catalog for creating the coverflow widget. Koha::Cache is supported in
order to make the widget load as quickly as possible!

The final step is to put your selector element somewhere in your public
catalog. In this example, I put the following in the system preference
OpacMainUserBlock:

::

    <span id="coverflow">Loading...</span>

Once that is in place, you need only refresh your OPAC page, and there
you have it, your very own catalog coverflow widget! Not only do these
coverflows look great on a computer screen, but they look great on
mobile platforms as well, and are even touch responsive!Coverflow Widget

Configuring Receipt Printers
============================

The following instructions are for specific receipt printers, but can
probably be used to help with setup of other brands as well.

`For Epson TM-T88III (3) & TM-T88IV (4) Printers <#epsonprinters>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------

`In the Print Driver <#epsonprintdriver>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For these instructions, we are using version 5,0,3,0 of the Epson
TM-T88III print driver; the EPSON TM-T88IV version is ReceiptE4.
Register at the `EpsonExpert Technical Resource Center
website <https://www.epsonexpert.com/login>`__ to gain access to the
drivers; go to Technical Resources, then choose the printer model from
the Printers drop-down list.

Click Start > Printers and Faxes > Right click the receipt printer >
Properties:

-  Advanced Tab, click Printing Defaults button

-  Layout Tab: Paper size: Roll Paper 80 x 297mm

-  TM-T88III: Layout Tab: Check Reduce Printing and Fit to Printable
   Width

-  TM-T88IV: Check Reduced Size Print; Click OK on the popup window that
   appears. Fit to Printable Width should be automatically selected.

-  OK your way out of there.

`In Firefox <#epsonfirefox>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under File > Page Setup:

-  Shrink to fit page on Format & Options tab

-  0,0,0,0 for Margins on Margins & Header/Footer Tab. This makes the
   receipts use all available space on the paper roll.

-  Set all Headers/Footers to -blank-. This removes all of the gunk you
   might normally find on a print from Firefox, such as the URL, number
   of pages, etc.

-  Click OK

Set the default printer settings in Firefox so you don't see a "Print"
dialog:

-  Go to File > Print

-  Set the Printer to the receipt printer.

-  Click the Advanced (or Properties) button

-  Layout Tab: Paper size: Roll Paper 80 x 297mm

-  TM-T88III: Layout Tab: Check Reduce Printing and Fit to Printable
   Width

-  TM-T88IV: Check Reduced Size Print; click OK on the popup window that
   appears. Fit to Printable Width should be automatically selected.

-  OK your way out, go ahead and print whatever page you are on.

-  Type about:config, in the address bar. Click "I'll be careful, I
   promise!" on the warning message.

-  Type, print.always in Filter.

-  Look for print.always\_print\_silent.

   -  If the preference is there then set the value to true.

-  If the preference is not there (and it shouldn't be in most browsers)
   you have to add the preference.

   -  Right click the preference area and select New > Boolean

   -  Type print.always\_print\_silent in the dialog box and set the
      value to True. This sets the print settings in Firefox to always
      use the same settings and print without showing a dialog box.

    **Warning**

    Setting the print.always\_print\_silent setting in about:config
    DISABLES the ability to choose a printer in Firefox.

the Printers drop-down list.

`In Firefox <#epson2firefox>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under File > Page Setup:

-  Shrink to fit page on Format & Options tab

-  0,0,0,0 for Margins on Margins & Header/Footer Tab. This makes the
   receipts use all available space on the paper roll.

-  Set all Headers/Footers to -blank-. This removes all of the gunk you
   might normally find on a print from Firefox, such as the URL, number
   of pages, etc.

-  Click OK

Set the default printer settings in Firefox so you don't see a "Print"
dialog:

-  Go to File > Print

-  Set the Printer to the receipt printer.

-  Print whatever page you are on.

-  Type about:config, in the address bar. Click "I'll be careful, I
   promise!" on the warning message.

-  Type, print.always in Filter.

-  Look for, print.always\_print\_silent.

   -  If the preference is there then set the value to true.

-  If the preference is not there (and it shouldn't be in most browsers)
   you have to add the preference.

   -  Right click the preference area and select New > Boolean

   -  Type, print.always\_print\_silent in the dialog box and set the
      value to True. This sets the print settings in Firefox to always
      use the same settings and print without showing a dialog box.

    **Warning**

    Setting the print.always\_print\_silent setting in about:config
    DISABLES the ability to choose a printer in Firefox.

`For Star SP542 Printers <#starprinter>`__
------------------------------------------

`Installing the Printer <#installstarprinter>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the following comments are based on the Star SP542 receipt
printer, they probably apply to all printers in the SP5xx series.

The Star SP542 receipt printer works well with Koha and **Firefox on
Windows XP SP3**. This printer, with either the parallel or USB
interface, is fairly easy to install and configure. You will need the
following executable file which is available from numerous places on the
Internet:

linemode\_2k-xp\_20030205.exe

This executable actually does all of the installation; you will not need
to use the Microsoft Windows "Add Printer" program. We recommend that
when installing, the option for the software monitor not be selected; we
have experienced significant pauses and delays in printing with it.
Instead, simply choose to install the receipt printer without the
monitor.

Additionally, the install program may not put the printer on the correct
port, especially if using the USB interface. This is easily corrected by
going to "Start -> Printers and Faxes -> Properties for the SP542
printer -> Ports", then check the appropriate port.

A reboot may be required, even if not indicated by the installation
software or the operating system.

**Windows 7** users should refer to this page:
http://www.starmicronics.com/supports/win7.aspx.

`Configuring Firefox to Print to Receipt Printer <#firefoxreceipt>`__
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Open File > Page Setup

-  Make all the headers and footers blank

-  Set the margins to 0 (zero)

-  In the address bar of Firefox, type about:config

-  Search for print.always\_print\_silent and double click it

-  Change it from false to true

   -  This lets you skip the Print pop up box that comes up, as well as
      skipping the step where you have to click OK, automatically
      printing the right sized slip.

-  If print.always\_print\_silent does not come up

   -  Right click on a blank area of the preference window

   -  Select new > Boolean

   -  Enter "print.always\_print\_silent" as the name (without quotes)

   -  Click OK

   -  Select true for the value

-  You may also want to check what is listed for print.print\_printer

   -  You may have to choose Generic/Text Only (or whatever your receipt
      printer might be named)

Notice & Slips Guides

`Field Guide for Notices & Slips <#noticesfieldguide>`__
--------------------------------------------------------

This guide will break down the notices and slips information in 3 ways.
First it will tell you what file generates the notice, then how you will
present the item info in that notice and finally if the notice can be
branch specific or not.

Sample Serials
==============

`Reader's Digest (0034-0375) <#readersdigestsample>`__
------------------------------------------------------

-  Published 12 times a year (monthly)

-  The Volume number changes every 6 months and the numbers continues on
   (requires an advanced pattern).

   Sample Reader's Digest Subscription
   |image1069|

`People Weekly (1076-0091) <#peoplesample>`__
---------------------------------------------

-  Published weekly

   -  The website says "on Saturday except the first week of August,
      Thanksgiving week, the first and last weeks of the year" but this
      does not match the pattern for 2007 or 2008

-  In the Jul-Dec there are 26 issues

-  In the Jan-Jun there are 25 issues (no issue for the first week of
   January)

Since the irregularity on the first # 26 does not skip a week, this
would be set up as to roll over on issue 25. The 26th issue in the
second half of the year would have to be received as a supplemental.

The irregularity check will complain that 52 issues were expected, but
25 entered. The current irregularity check can only check that the first
position of the numbering pattern matches the expected issue count of
the periodicity. But we do need to trigger the rollover on the volume,
so we need to define the last two weeks of the year as irregularities.
So we receive 50 issues the first 50 weeks, then one supplemental issue
in week 51, which we have to define the enumeration for, then the next
predicted issue will be the following year's first week.

`Et-Mol <#hebrewserialsample>`__
--------------------------------

This journal is published with the following rules:

-  6 issues a year (every 2 months)

-  year changes every 6 issues

-  we start in 2011

-  the issue number goes up indefinitely

-  starting from issue 215

The planning would look like this:

Sample for this Hebrew Journal
|image1070|

`Backpacker (0277-867X) <#backpackerserial>`__
----------------------------------------------

Published 9 times a year irregularly. The issues continues while the
volume and number rolls over every 9 issues. If you're holding Volume
41, Number 3, Issue 302 in your hand the prediction would look like
this:

Backpacker numbering pattern
|image1071|

And the received issues would number like this:

v. 41, no. 3, iss. 302  

v. 41, no. 4, iss. 303

v. 41, no. 5, iss. 304

v. 41, no. 6, iss. 305

v. 41, no. 7, iss. 306

v. 41, no. 8, iss. 307

v. 41, no. 9, iss. 308

v. 42, no. 1, iss. 309

v. 42, no. 2, iss. 310

Using Koha as a Content Management System (CMS)
===============================================

`Setup <#kohacmssetup>`__
-------------------------

These are instructions for taking a default install of Koha and allowing
it to function as a little content management system. This will allow a
library to publish an arbitrary number of pages based on a template.
This example uses the template for the main opac page, but you could
just as well use any template you wish with a bit more editing. This may
be appropriate if you have a small library, want to allow librarians to
easily add pages, and do not want to support a complete CMS.

-  Copy /usr/share/koha/opac/cgi-bin/opac/opac-main.pl to
   /usr/share/koha/opac/cgi-bin/opac/pages.pl (in the same directory)

-  Edit pages.pl in an editor

-  At approximately line 33 change this code:

   ::

       template_name  => "opac-main.tmpl",

-  To this code:

   ::

       template_name  => "pages.tmpl",

-  At approximately line 62 after this code:

   ::

       $template->param(
                  koha_news       => $all_koha_news,
                  koha_news_count => $koha_news_count,
                  display_daily_quote => C4::Context->preference('QuoteOfTheDay'),
                  daily_quote         => $quote,
                  );

-  Add these lines:

   ::

               my $page = "page_" . $input->param('p');          # go for "p" value in URL and do the concatenation
               my $preference = C4::Context->preference($page);  # Go for preference
               $template->{VARS}->{'page_test'} = $preference;   # pass variable to template pages.tt

-  Note pages.pl file must have Webserver user execution permissions,
   you can use `chmod <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod>`__ command if
   you are actually logged in as such user:

   ::

               $chmod 755 pages.pl

-  In the browser go to Home > Administration > System Preferences >
   Local Use and add a New Preference called "page\_test"

-  Fill it out as so

   -  Explanation: test page for pages tiny cms

   -  Variable: page\_test

   -  Value: Lorem ipsum

   -  Click the TextArea link (or enter "TextArea" into the input field
      below it)

   -  variable options (last field): 80\|50

-  In a browser go to http://youraddress/cgi-bin/koha/pages.pl?p=test
   The page should come up with the words "Lorem ipsum" in the main
   content area of the page. (replace "youraddress" with localhost,
   127.0.0.1, or your domain name depending on how you have Apache set
   up.)

-  To add more pages simply create a system preference where the title
   begins with "page\_" followed by any arbitrary letters. You can add
   any markup you want as the value of the field. Reference the new page
   by changing the value of the "p" parameter in the URL.

To learn more visit the Koha wiki page on this topic:
http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Koha_as_a_CMS

`Editing the pages template <#kohacmstmpl>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file to create / edit for the pages template will depend on your
`opacthemes <#opacthemes>`__ system preference setting

`Editing 'bootstrap' theme template (current) <#kohacmstmplboot>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Copy
   /usr/share/koha/opac/htdocs/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/modules/opac-main.tt
   to
   /usr/share/koha/opac/htdocs/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/modules/pages.tt

-  Edit
   /usr/share/koha/opac/htdocs/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/modules/pages.tt

-  At approximately line 61, change this:

   ::

               [% IF ( OpacMainUserBlock ) %]<div id="opacmainuserblock">[% OpacMainUserBlock %]</div>[% END %]

-  To this:

   ::

               [% IF ( page_test ) %]<div id="opacmainuserblock">[% page_test %]</div>[% END %]

Remark: You may wish to disable your News block of these CMS style pages
e.g. when you do not want it displayed on the CMS style pages or where
the News block is long enough that it actually makes the 'page\_test'
include scroll outside the default viewport dimensions. In that case,
remove the following code from your pages.tt template.

::

                      [% IF ( koha_news_count ) %]
                          <div id="news">
                          <table class="table table-bordered">
                          [% FOREACH koha_new IN koha_news %]
                            <thead><tr><th>[% koha_new.title %]</th></tr></thead>
                            <tbody><tr><td><p>[% koha_new.new %]</p>
                            <p class="newsfooter"><i>(published on [% koha_new.newdate %])</i></p></td></tr></tbody>
                          [% END %]
                          </table>
                          </div>
                         [% END %]


`Troubleshooting <#kohacmstrouble>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have problems check file permissions on pages.pl and pages.tmpl.
They should have the same user and group as other Koha files like
opac-main.pl.

`Bonus Points <#kohacmsbonus>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using the address
http://youraddress/cgi-bin/koha/pages.pl?p=test you can shorten it to
http://youraddress/pages.pl?p=test Just open up
/etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf and add the follow at about line 13:

::

    ScriptAlias /pages.pl "/usr/share/koha/opac/cgi-bin/opac/pages.pl"

Then restart Apache.

`Usage <#kohacmsusage>`__
-------------------------

After setting up Koha as a CMS you can create new pages following these
instructions:

`Adding Pages <#kohacmspages>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new page you need to add a system preference under Local Use.

-  Get there: More > Administration > Global System Preferences > Local
   Use

-  Click 'New Preference'

-  Enter in a description in the Explanation field

-  Enter a value that starts with 'page\_' in the Variable field

-  Enter starting HTML in the Value field

   Add a new preference
   |image1076|

-  Set the Variable Type to Textarea

-  Set the Variable options to something like 20\|20 for 20 rows and 20
   columns

   Settings for the new preference
   |image1077|

`Viewing your page <#kohacmsview>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view your new page at
http://YOUR-OPAC/cgi-bin/koha/pages.pl?p=PAGENAME where PAGENAME is the
part you entered after 'page\_' in the Variable field.

`Example <#kohacmsexpage>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This process can be used to create recommended reading lists within
Koha. So once the code changes have been made per the instructions on
'Koha as a CMS' you go through the 'Adding a New Page' instructions
above to great a page for 'Recommended Reading Lists'

Create page by modifying a system preference
|image1078|

Next we need to create pages for our various classes (or categories). To
do this, return to the 'Adding a New Page' section and create a
preference for the first class.

Add a new sys pref for another page
|image1079|

Next you'll want to link your first page to your new second page, go to
the page\_recommend preference and click 'Edit.' Now you want to edit
the HTML to include a link to your newest page:

Edit original preference to add new page
|image1080|

-  The Crawford Library at Dallas Christian College is using this method
   for their recommended reading lists: http://opac.dallas.edu/

Resetting the Koha Database
===========================

These notes on how to reset the database for Koha were derived from the
following email thread:
http://lists.koha-community.org/pipermail/koha-devel/2009-January/008939.html
and http://lists.katipo.co.nz/public/koha/2014-June/039701.html

Resetting the database may be useful if you install Koha with the sample
data, and then wish to use real data without reinstalling the software.

`Delete sample data from Tables <#deletetables>`__
--------------------------------------------------

Use your preferred MySQL client to
`delete <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/delete.html>`__ the
following tables:

-  bibio

-  biblioitems

-  items

-  auth\_header

-  sessions

-  zebraqueue

You may need to disable foreign key checks to delete data from same
tables. For instructions follow this thread:
https://lists.katipo.co.nz/pipermail/koha/2013-July/036853.html.

`Reset the Zebra Index <#resetzebra>`__
---------------------------------------

Run the following commands to reset the authorities and biblios Zebra
indices.

::

    $ zebraidx -c /etc/koha/zebradb/zebra-authorities-dom.cfg -g iso2709 -d authorities init
    $ zebraidx -c /etc/koha/zebradb/zebra-biblios.cfg -g iso2709 -d biblios init

If you are running a package install then you'll want to run the
following commands to reset the authorities and biblios Zebra indices
instead:

::

    $ sudo zebraidx -c /etc/koha/sites/YOURLIBRARY/zebra-authorities-dom.cfg  -g iso2709 -d authorities init
    $ sudo zebraidx -c /etc/koha/sites/YOURLIBRARY/zebra-biblios.cfg  -g iso2709 -d biblios init

Replacing YOURLIBRARY with your Koha installation name.

Koha XSLT Item Types
====================

When you have any of the XSLT system preferences
(`OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay <#OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay>`__,
`OPACXSLTResultsDisplay <#OPACXSLTResultsDisplay>`__,
`XSLTDetailsDisplay <#XSLTDetailsDisplay>`__, and/or
`XSLTResultsDisplay <#XSLTResultsDisplay>`__) along with the
`DisplayOPACiconsXSLT <#DisplayOPACiconsXSLT>`__ and
`DisplayIconsXSLT <#DisplayIconsXSLT>`__ preferences turned on you will
see item type icons on the related screen.

    **Important**

    These images are coming from values found in your leader, if your
    leader is not cataloged properly it might be best to turn off the
    `DisplayOPACiconsXSLT <#DisplayOPACiconsXSLT>`__ preference (which
    can be done while leaving the other XSLT preferences turned on).

MarcEdit
========

Many libraries like to use MarcEdit for modifications or data cleanup.
If you'd like to do this you will need to download it at:
http://marcedit.reeset.net/

    **Important**

    Many of the actions described in this chapter can be done in Koha
    using `Marc Modification Templates <#marcmodtemplates>`__, but this
    section is here for those who are used to MarcEdit.

`Adding a prefix to call numbers <#marceditprefix>`__
-----------------------------------------------------

When bringing data into Koha, you may want to first clean it up. One
common action among Koha users is to add a prefix to the call number.

-  Open MarcEdit

   MarcEdit
   |image1089|

-  Click 'MarcEditor'

-  Go to Tools > Edit Subfield Data

   Edit subfield data
   |image1090|

-  To prepend data the special character is: ^b  To simply prepend data
   to the beginning of a subfield, add ^b to the Field Data: textbox and
   the data to be appended in the Replace

   Prepend data to a field
   |image1091|

   -  To prepend data to the beginning of the subfield while replacing a
      text string, add ^b[string to replace] to the Field Data textbox
      and the data to be appended in the Replace With textbox.

`Importing Excel data into Koha <#marceditexcel>`__
---------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have records of your library in excel data sheet format and
want them to import into Koha. But how will you do this? Koha will not
let you import excel records directly. Well here is a very simple
solution for you which will let you import your excel records in Koha
easily. First, we will convert excel file into Marc file and then will
import it into Koha.

Follow the given steps to import your excel records into Koha

`Converting from Excel format into .mrk format <#convertexcel>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we will convert excel format into .mrk format. For this we will
use MarcEdit. You can download it from http://marcedit.reeset.net/

Now open it and select Add-ins-->Delimited Text Translator.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1092|

Click Next when the following window appears.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1093|

Browse for your excel file.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1094|

Locate your excel file by choosing the format Excel File(\*.xls).

Delimited Text Translator
|image1095|

Similarly, fill all the other entries such as Output File, Excel Sheet
Name and check UTF-8 Encoded (if required) and Click Next.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1096|

Now you will be prompted for mapping the fields to recognise the fields
by standard marc format.

Suppose for Field 0 that is first column I entered Map to: 022$a( Valid
ISSN for the continuing resource) and then click on Apply.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1097|

    **Note**

    You can customize Indicators and all other things, for more
    information on marc21 format visit the `official library of congress
    site <http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/>`__.

Similarly map all other fields and then Click on Finish.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1098|

And then a window will appear indicating that your Marc Text
File(\*.mrk) has been created.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1099|

Click Close and we have created a .mrk file from .xls file in this step.
You can view the file by double clicking on it.

`Convert .mrk file to .mrc <#convertmrk>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will convert .mrk file that we have created in the above step into
raw Marc format that can be directly imported into Koha.

For this again open MarcEdit and Select MARC Tools.

MARC Tools
|image1100|

Next Select MarcMaker to convert .mrk file into .mrc format.

MarcMaker
|image1101|

Locate your input file and name your output file. Then Click Execute.

MarcMaker
|image1102|

And it will show you the Result.

MarcMaker
|image1103|

Click Close and now we have raw Marc records with us (.mrc file).

`Import .mrc into Koha <#importmrc>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More information on importing records into Koha can be found in the
'`Stage MARC Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__' section of this manual.

Finally we will import above created .mrc file into Koha.

Click on Tools in your Koha staff client.

Koha Staff Client
|image1104|

Next Click on Stage MARC Records for Import.

Stage MARC Records for Import
|image1105|

After this, choose your previously created .mrc file and click on
Upload.

Stage File
|image1106|

You can also add comment about file and finally click on Stage For
Import.

Stage for Import
|image1107|

When the import is done, you will get a result something like this

Staged Records Summary
|image1108|

Next, click on Manage staged records.

Here you can even change matching rules.

Manage Staged Records
|image1109|

Click on Import this batch into catalog when you are done.

Thats it. After all the records get imported, check Status and it should
read "imported"

Finalize Import
|image1110|

You can even undo the Import operation.

And within few minutes, we have imported around 10,000 records in Koha

3. If you wish, archive the results file in another directory after
   processing

Run TalkingTech\_itiva\_inbound.pl --help for more information

OCLC Connexion Gateway
======================

Koha can be set to work with the OCLC Connextion Gateway. This allows
libraries to use OCLC Connexion as their cataloging tool and simply send
those records to Koha with a single click. The following instructions
will help you set up the OCLC Connexion Gateway, if you have a system
administrator you will want to consult with them on this process.

`Setting up OCLC service on Koha <#oclckohasetup>`__
----------------------------------------------------

First, you'll need to create a file somewhere on your system with
configuration information.  You could put this anywhere that is visible
to the account that will be running the service.

The file contains 11 lines. The first 6 will be about your Koha system:

::

    host: The IP address of your Koha server
    port: The port you want to use for the Connexion service. This port must be different from your SIP port, or any other service
    koha: The full URL of your staff client
    log: The location (full file specification) of your log for the service
    user: The default Koha username to use for importing
    password: The password that goes with that username

The remaining lines describe how to do the staging:

::

    match: The name of the matching rule from your system to use
    overlay_action: "replace", "create_new", or "ignore"-- what to do if there is a match
    nomatch_action: "create_new" or "ignore"-- what to do if there is no match
    item_action: "always_add","add_only_for_matches","add_only_for_new", or "ignore" -- what to do with embedded 952 item data
    import_mode: "direct" or "stage"

A sample file would look like this:

::

    host: 1.2.3.4
    port: 8000
    log: /home/koha/koha-dev/var/log/connexion.log
    koha: http://kohastaff.myuniversity.edu
    user: koha_generic_staff
    password: password
    match: 001
    overlay_action: replace
    nomatch_action: create_new
    item_action: ignore
    import_mode: direct

When choosing an 'import\_mode' if you use "direct" then the staged
record will be immediately imported into Koha, and should be searchable
after your indexes catch up.  If you choose "stage", then the record
will be placed in a staged batch for you to later go the `Manage Staged
MARC Records <#managestaged>`__ tool to finish the import.

If you import multiple records, they'll be in the same batch, until that
batch is imported, then a new batch will be created.

In "direct" mode, each record will be in its' own batch.

To start the service, run the script:

::

    /location/of/connexion/import/daemon/connexion_import_daemon.pl -d -c /location/of/config/file.cnf

`Setting up your OCLC desktop client <#oclcdesktopsetup>`__
-----------------------------------------------------------

    **Note**

    Screenshots are OCLC Connexion Client v.2.50, Koha v.3.12

To set up the OCLC Connexion desktop client to connect to Koha, go to
Tools > Options, then choose the Export tab. Connexion Export Tab

-  Click the "Create..." button to set up a new destination, then choose
   "OCLC Gateway Export" and click OK.

   -  Enter the following information:

      -  "Host Name:" Your catalog’s appropriate IP address (from your
         `config file above <#oclckohasetup>`__)

      -  "Port:" Your catalog's appropriate port number (from your
         `config file above <#oclckohasetup>`__)

      -  "Login ID:" The cataloger's Koha login

      -  "Password:" The cataloger's Koha password

      -  "Notify Host Before Disconnect" = checked,

      -  "Timeout" = 100, "Retries" = 3, "Delay" = 0 (zero),

      -  "Send Local System Logon ID Password" = checked.

   OCLC Gateway Export Settings
   |image1111|

-  Select "OK" when finished, and you should see your new "Gateway
   Export" option listed (The catalog's IP address and port are blacked
   out in the following screenshot)

   Gateway Export Added

-  Click on "Record Characteristics" and make sure that the
   bibliographic records are using MARC21, UTF-8 Unicode, and click OK
   to save.

   Record Characteristics

You should be ready to go!  To export a record from OCLC Connexion
Client to Koha, just press F5 while the record is on-screen.  The export
dialog will pop up, and you'll see Connexion attempting to talk to Koha.
 You should get a message that the record was added or overlaid,
including its biblio number, and a URL that you can copy into your web
browser to jump straight to the record.

`Using the OCLC Connexion Gateway <#oclcgateway>`__
---------------------------------------------------

Records can be exported from Connexion either in a batch or one by one.

`Exporting records one by one <#oclconeexport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To export bibliographic records one by one, be sure your "Batch" options
are correct: from the "Tools" menu, select "Options", and select the
"Batch" tab. In the "Perform local actions in batch" area,
"Bibliographic Record Export" should be uncheckedConnexion batch options

When ready to export, from the "Action" menu, select "Export" or use the
F5 key. You will see a screen similar to the following if the import is
successful and if the record is new to the Catalog; you may copy & paste
the resulting URL into your Koha catalog to see the new record.Connexion
Export

If the record was overlaid, you will see a message to that effect in the
"OCLC Gateway Export Status" windowOverlay confirmation

`Exporting records in a batch <#oclcbatchexport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To export bibliographic records in a batch, be sure your "Batch" options
are correct: from the "Tools" menu, select "Options", and select the
"Batch" tab. In the "Perform local actions in batch" area,
"Bibliographic Record Export" should be checkedOCLC Batch Export Options

When a record is ready to export, from the "Action" menu, select
"Export" or use the F5 key, and it’s export status will be "ready."

When ready to export the batch, from the "Batch" menu, select "Process
batch" and check the appropriate "Path" and "Export" boxesBatch import
process

The export will begin, and the bib records will be exported & imported
into Koha one by one; you will see "OCLC Gateway Export Status" windows,
as above, showing you the results of each export. That window will stay
there until you select "Close," and then the next record’s export/import
will begin. The process will continue until all records in the batch are
completed. Then you may or may not see the Connexion Client export
report (depending on your Client options for that).

`Items in OCLC <#oclcitems>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like to create your item records in OCLC you can do so by
addding a 952 for each item to the bib record you're cataloging. The
`Item/Holdings Cataloging Guide <#itemcatguide>`__ will break down what
subfields you can use in the 952, but at the minimum you want to have
subfield 2, a, b, and y on your items.

952
\\\\$2CLASSIFICATION$aHOMEBRANCHCODE$bHOLDINGBRANCHCODE$yITEMTYPECODE

-  The subfield 2 holds the classification code. This can be ddc for
   Dewey or lcc for Library of Congress or z for Custom. Other
   classification sources can be found in the `Classification
   Sources <#classificationsources>`__ area in administration

-  Subfield a is your home library and needs to be the code for your
   home library, not the library name. You can find these codes in the
   `Libraries & Groups <#libsgroups>`__ administration area.

-  Subfield b is your holding library and needs to be the code for your
   holding library, not the library name. You can find these codes in
   the `Libraries & Groups <#libsgroups>`__ administration area.

-  Subfield y is your item type code. It needs to be the code, not the
   item type name. You can find these codes in the `Item
   Types <#itemtypeadmin>`__ administration area.

952 \\\\$2ddc$aMAIN$bMAIN$yBOOK

In addition to these required fields you can enter any other subfield
you'd like. Most libraries will enter a call number in subfield o and a
barcode in subfield p as well. Review the `Item/Holdings Cataloging
Guide <#itemcatguide>`__ for a full list of subfields and values.

FAQs
====

`Display <#displayfaq>`__
-------------------------

`Custom Item Type/Authorized Value Icons <#customicons>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question:** Can I have my own set of item type images (or authorized
value icons)?

**Answer:**\ Absolutely. To add additional icons to your system you
simply add a new directory to
koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/img/itemtypeimg/ and to
koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/prog/itemtypeimg and put your icons in the new
directory. Your icons will show up in a new tab as soon as they are in
the folders.

-  **Note**

       Remember to put the icons in both places (on the OPAC and the
       intranet).

`Customizing Koha Images <#customkohaimages>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Can I customize the images in the OPAC?

**Answer**: Absolutely. Koha comes with a series of original images that
you can alter to meet your needs. The originals can be found in the
misc/interface\_customization/ directory.

`OPAC Display Fields <#opacdisplayfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What MARC fields print to the different OPAC screens in
Koha?

**Answer**: The XSLT preference must be set as follows for the following
fields to show

-  `OPACXSLTResultsDisplay <#OPACXSLTResultsDisplay>`__ = using XSLT
   stylesheets

-  `OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay <#OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay>`__ = using XSLT

**Question**: How do I get the subtitle to display on the detail pages
for my bib records?

**Answer**: Subtitle display now depends on there being a `keyword
mapping <#keywordmapping>`__ for the MARC field in question. Adding a
mapping for "subtitle" -> "245b" for an item's framework results in
display of the subtitle in OPAC and staff client search and detail pages
(although not in all instances where subtitles might be displayed, e.g.
the Cart).

`Show patrons the barcodes of items they have checked out <#opacbarcodesfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Can patrons see the barcodes for the items they have
checked out.

**Answer**: Not by default, but with a few edits to the patron record
you can make a barcode column appear on the patron's check out summary
in the OPAC. You can set up a `patron
attribute <#patronattributetypes>`__ with the value of SHOW\_BCODE and
`authorized value <#authorizedvalues>`__ of YES\_NO to make this happen.

Add SHOW\_BCODE patron attribute
|image1112|

Then on the `patron's record set the value <#editpatrons>`__ for
SHOW\_BCODE to yes.

Setting value for SHOW\_BCODE on patron record
|image1113|

This will add a column to the check out summary in the OPAC that shows
the patrons the barcodes of the items they have checked out.

Clicking on the 'Overdue' tab will show only the items that are overdue.

`Circulation/Notices <#circfaq>`__
----------------------------------

`Book drop Date <#dropboxfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: How is the book drop date is determined? Is it the last
open date for the checkout branch? Is it today's date minus one? Can the
book drop checkin date be set?

**Answer**: If the library is closed for four days for renovations, for
example, there would be more than one day needed for the book drop date.
You will only have one book drop date and that will be the last day that
the library open (determined by the holiday calendar) because there is
no real way to know what day the books were dropped into the box during
the 4 closed days. The only way to change the effective checkin date in
book drop mode is to modify the calendar.

`Holds to Pull and Holds Queue <#holdsreportsfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What is the difference between the `Holds
Queue <#holdsqueue>`__ and `Holds to Pull <#holdspull>`__?

**Answer**: The holds to pull report gives a simple list of what holds
need to be filled with available items. It should only be used in Koha
installations where there is only one library.

The holds queue tries to do the same thing, but in a 'smarter' way. This
allows it to split up the list by library, consult the `transport cost
matrix <#transportcostmatrix>`__ and refresh regularly to provide
different pull lists to each library.

`Duplicate Overdue Notices <#dupoverduefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Why are patrons getting two overdue notices?

**Answer**: This tool takes all branches in the overdue rules and sent
notifications to them. So, if you have a default rule & a branch rule,
the notification will be generated twice. A quick fix is to discard
"default rule" for instance.

`Printing Overdue Notices <#printoverduefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Can I print overdue notices for patrons without email
addresses on file?

**Answer**: Yes. The `overdue notice cron job <#overduenoticecron>`__
has a setting to generate the overdue notices as HTML for printing. An
example of this usage would be:

::

    overdue_notices.pl -t -html /tmp/noticedir -itemscontent issuedate,date_due,title,barcode,author

In this example, we wanted to use only certain item fields in our
notices, so we specified itemscontent fields in the cron entry; that's
not a requirement for the feature.

The command line needs to specify a web-accessible directory where the
print notices will go -- they get a filename like
notices-2009-11-24.html (or holdnotices-2009-11-24.html). The overdue
notice itself can be formatted to fit a Z-mailer. Within the notice
file, the text is spaced down or over to where it will print properly on
the form. The script has code that wraps around the notice file to tell
the HTML to obey the formatting, and to do a page break between notices.
That's so that when staff print it out, they get one per page. We had to
add an extra syspref (`PrintNoticesMaxLines <#PrintNoticesMaxLines>`__)
to specify page length because our client allows a \_lot\_ of checkouts
which meant some notices were running onto multiple pages. That syspref
says to truncate the print notice at that page length and put in a
message about go check your OPAC account for the full list.

The print and email overdues use the same notice file. The print notices
for holds are different -- there's a separate HOLD\_PRINT notice file
and the system uses it if there's no email address. Then a nightly cron
job runs to gather those up from the message queue and put them in an
HTML file in the notice directory, as above.

The cron entry is gather\_print\_notices.pl /tmp/noticedir

`Unable to Renew Items <#renewfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: We're trying to renew some items for our patron. One of
the items is on hold and ineligible for renewal, but the other two items
refuse to renew even though they should be eligible. When I try to use
the override renewal limit, it just returns a little message that says
"renewal failed". Any idea what's going on here?

**Answer**: At the very least you will need to set an absolute `default
circulation rule <#circfinerules>`__. This rule should be set for the
default itemtype, default branchcode and default patron category. That
will catch anyone who doesn't match a specific rule. Patrons who do not
match a specific rule will get blocked from placing holds or renewing
items, since there was no baseline number of holds or renewals to
utilize.

`Unable to Place Holds <#holdsfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Why can't I place holds when I have all of the preferences
turned on.

**Answer**: You probably need to set a default circulation rule. At the
very least you will need to set an default circulation rule. This rule
should be set for all item types, all branches and all patron
categories. That will catch all instances that do not match a specific
rule. When checking out if you do not have a rule for the default
branch, default item and default patron category then you may see
patrons getting blocked from placing holds.

`Keyboard Shortcuts <#keyboardshort>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Do I have to use my mouse to access the checkout, checkin
and cataloging tabs at the top of the circulation pages?

**Answer**: You can jump between the tabs on the quick search box at the
top of the screen by using the following hot keys (if the tab is
available):

-  jump to the catalog search with Alt+Q

-  jump to the checkout with Alt+U

   -  this will not work for Mac user

-  jump to the checkin with Alt+R

    **Note**

    Mac users use the OPTION button in place of ALT

`SMS Notices/Messages <#smsnoticefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: I want Koha to send notices via SMS, what do I need to do?

**Answer**: First you need to choose a SMS service to use with Koha.
There is a list available here:
http://search.cpan.org/search?query=sms%3A%3Asend&mode=all Not all SMS
services available to libraries have Perl drivers, so be sure to check
this list to see if the provider you're considering is listed. If not
you want to ask your provider if they have a Perl module, if not you
should consider another service. Some common options in the US (that
have Perl drivers) are:

-  AQL (`www.aql.com <http://www.aql.com>`__)

-  Wadja (`wadja.com <http://wadja.com>`__)

-  Ipipi (`ipipi.com <http://ipipi.com>`__)

-  T-mobile

-  SMSDiscount (`smsdiscount.com <http://smsdiscount.com>`__)

-  Clickatell

**Question**: What about in India?

**Answer**: India does not yet have too many options here. This is
partly due to the Telecom regulatory authority's (TRAI) stipulations
about transactional SMSes and limits on the number of SMSes that may be
sent / received per users per day. India specific drivers include:

-  Unicel Technologies Pvt Ltd (`unicel.in <http://unicel.in>`__)

`Cataloging <#catfaq>`__
------------------------

`Authority Fields <#authorityfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question:**\ Why can't I edit 1xx, 6xx, or 7xx fields in my catalog
record?

**Answer:** These fields are authority controlled and you probably have
the `BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__ set to "Don't
allow". When it is set to "Don't allow" these fields will be locked and
require you to search for an existing authority record to populate the
field with. To allow typing in these authority fields set
`BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__ to 'Allow'.

    **Note**

    Fields affected by this preference will show a lock symbol in them

Fields affected by this preference show a lock in the field
|image1115|

`Koha to MARC Mapping <#kohamarcfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What's the relationship between 'Koha to MARC Mapping' and
'MARC Bibliographic Frameworks'?

**Answer**: Mapping can be defined through 'MARC Bibliographic
Frameworks' OR 'Koha to MARC Mapping'. 'Koha to MARC Mapping' is just a
shortcut to speed up linkage. If you change a mapping in one of these
modules, the mapping will change in the other as well. (In other words,
the two modules 'overwrite' each other in order to prevent conflicts
from existing in Koha).

`Number of Items Per Bib Record <#itemsperbibfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Is there a limit on the number of items I can attach to a
bib record?

**Answer**: There is no explicit limit to the number of items you can
attach to a bibliographic record, but if you attach enough of them, your
MARC record will exceed the maximum file size limit for the ISO 2709
standard, which breaks indexing for that record. I've found this occurs
somewhere between 600 and 1000 items on a 'normal' bibliographic record.

`Analytics <#analyticsfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: I am using the
`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ feature, but my links
in the OPAC and Staff Client to 'Show Analytics' are not working.

**Answer**: If you plan on using
`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ you will want to make
sure to set your `UseControlNumber <#UseControlNumber>`__ preference to
"Don't use," this will prevent broken links.

`Acquisitions <#acqfaq>`__
--------------------------

`Planning Categories <#planningcatfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What is a planning category?

**Answer**: When you plan in advance for the way your budget is going to
be spent, you initially plan for how it's going to be spent over time,
that's the most natural thing to do.

So you plan for $1000 in Jan. $1000 in Feb., $3000 in March, etc. You
can basically do the same thing with a list of values in lieu of the
months.

Say you have a list like this one:

-  < 1 month

-  < 6 months

-  < 1 year

-  < 3 years

-  < 10 years

-  > 10 years

The list is meant to represent when the books acquired where published.
Then you plan for it, saying: we went to spend at list 40% of our
budgets on books published less than a year ago, 10% on books more than
10 years old, etc.

Upon acquiring new material, you'll be able to select, for a given item,
a value from this list in a drop down. Then, after the material has been
acquired, at the end of the year, you'll be able to compare the goals
set, with what's been achieved.

`Serials <#serialsfaq>`__
-------------------------

`Advanced Patterns <#advancedpatternfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What is the 'inner counter' on the advanced serials
pattern interface?

**Answer**: I think it is better to give an example to understand this :

Example for a monthly subscription :

-  First issue publication date : April 2010

-  Numbering : No {X}, year {Y}

-  First issue : No 4, year 2010

For the year Y : you will want the year change on January 2011

So, the advanced pattern for Y will be :

-  Add : 1

-  once every : 12

-  When more than 9999999

-  inner counter : 3

-  Set back to 0

-  Begins with 2010

Year is going to change after 12 received issues from April 2010, that
is in April 2011 if you don't set inner counter. Set inner counter to 3
will say to Koha : change year after 12-3 = 9 received issues.

Inner counter says to Koha to take into account the first issues of the
year, even if they are not received with Koha. If you begin with first
issue of the year write nothing or 0.

`Reports <#reportsfaq>`__
-------------------------

`Define Codes Stored in DB <#accounttypefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Fines Table <#finescodefaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question:** What do the codes in the accounttype field in the
accountlines table stand for?

**Answer:**

-  A = Account management fee

-  C = Credit

-  F = Overdue fine

-  FOR = Forgiven

-  FU = Overdue, still acccruing

-  L = Lost item

-  LR = Lost item returned/refunded

-  M = Sundry

-  N = New card

-  PAY = Payment

-  W = Writeoff

`Statistics Table <#statscodefaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question:**\ What are the possible codes for the type field in the
statistics table?

      patron (category type = 'X') is returned

-  issue

-  return

-  renew

-  writeoff

-  payment

-  CreditXXX

   -  The XXX stores different types of fee credits, so a query to catch
      them all would include a clause like "type LIKE 'Credit%'"

`Reserves Table <#rescodefaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: What are the possible codes for the found field in the
reserves and old\_reserves tables?

**Answer**:

-  NULL: means the patron requested the 1st available, and we haven't
   chosen the item

-  T = Transit: the reserve is linked to an item but is in transit to
   the pickup branch

-  W = Waiting: the reserve is linked to an item, is at the pickup
   branch, and is waiting on the hold shelf

-  F = Finished: the reserve has been completed, and is done

-  44 = Missing (lost)

`Borrowers Table <#borrowerprivacyvalues>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: What are the possible codes for the privacy field in the
borrowers table?

**Answer**:

-  0 = Forever

-  1 = Default

-  2 = Never

`Messaging Preferences <#messpreffaq>`__

**Question**: What are the possible codes in the message\_attribute\_id
field in the borrower\_message\_preferences table?

**Answer**:

-  2 = advanced notice

-  6 = item checkout

-  4 = hold filled

-  1 = item due

-  5 = item check in

`Runtime Parameters <#runtimefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Is there a way to filter my custom SQL reports before they
run?

**Answer**: If you feel that your report might be too resource intensive
you might want to consider using runtime parameters to your query.
Runtime parameters basically make a filter appear before the report is
run to save your system resources.

There is a specific syntax that Koha will understand as 'ask for values
when running the report'. The syntax is <<Question to
ask\|authorized\_value>>.

-  The << and >> are just delimiters. You must put << at the beginning
   and >> at the end of your parameter

-  The 'Question to ask' will be displayed on the left of the string to
   enter.

-  The authorized\_value can be omitted if not applicable. If it
   contains an authorized value category, or branches or itemtype or
   categorycode or biblio\_framework, a list with the Koha authorized
   values will be displayed instead of a free field Note that you can
   have more than one parameter in a given SQL Note that entering
   nothing at run time won't probably work as you expect. It will be
   considered as "value empty" not as "ignore this parameter". For
   example entering nothing for : "title=<<Enter title>>" will display
   results with title='' (no title). If you want to have to have
   something not mandatory, use "title like <<Enter title>>" and enter a
   % at run time instead of nothing

Examples:

-  SELECT surname,firstname FROM borrowers WHERE branchcode=<<Enter
   patrons library\|branches>> AND surname like <<Enter filter for
   patron surname (% if none)>>

-  SELECT \* FROM items WHERE homebranch = <<Pick your
   branch\|branches>> and barcode like <<Partial barcode value here>>

-  SELECT title , author FROM biblio WHERE frameworkcode=<<Enter the
   frameworkcode\|biblio\_framework>>

    **Note**

    To generate a date picker calendar to the right of the field when
    running a report you can use the 'date' keyword like this: <<Enter
    Date\|date>>

    Date Picker
    |image1116|

    **Note**

    You have to put "%" in a text box to 'leave it blank'. Otherwise, it
    literally looks for "" (empty string) as the value for the field.

    **Important**

    In addition to using any authorized value code to generate a
    dropdown, you can use the following values as well: Framework codes
    (biblio\_framework), Branches (branches), Item Types (itemtypes) and
    Patron Categories (categorycode). For example a branch pull down
    would be generated like this <<Branch\|branches>>

    Branch pull down
    |image1117|

`Results Limited <#reportlimitfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: When I download my report it's limited to 10,000 results,
how do I get all of the results to download?

**Answer**: There is a limit of 10,000 records put on SQL statements
entered in Koha. To get around this you want to add 'LIMIT 100000' to
the end of your SQL statement (or any other number above 10,000.

`Searching <#searchfaq>`__
--------------------------

`Advanced Search <#advancedsearchfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Scan Indexes <#scanindexfaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: What does 'scan indexes' on the advanced search page mean?

**Answer**: When you choose an index, enter a term, click 'scan indexes'
and do the search, Koha displays the searched term and the following
terms found in this index with the number of corresponding records That
is search is not made directly in the catalog, but first in the indexes
It works only for one index at once, and only with no limit in Location
(All libraries needed)

`Searching for Terms that Start With a Character <#searchstartswith>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: How do I search for all titles that start with the letter
'C'?

**Answer**: You can choose to search for things that start with a
character or series of characters by using the CCL 'first-in-subfield'

-  example: ti,first-in-subfield=C

`Wildcard Searching <#wildcardsearchfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**:What is the difference between a keyword search using the
'\*' (asterisk) versus a keyword search using the '%' (percent)? Both
work in the catalog, but return different sets. Why?

**Answer**: A wildcard is a character (\*,?,%,.) that can be used to
represent one or more characters in a word. Two of the wildcard
characters that can be used in Koha searches are the asterisk ('\*') and
the percent sign ('%'). However, these two characters act differently
when used in searching.

The '\*' is going to force a more exact search of the first few
characters you enter prior to the '\*'. The asterisk will allow for an
infinite number of characters in the search as long as the first few
characters designated by your search remain the same. For example,
searching for authors using the term, Smi\*, will return a list that may
include Smith, Smithers, Smithfield, Smiley, etc depending on the
authors in your database.

The '%' will treat the words you enter in the terms of "is like". So a
search of Smi% will search for words like Smi. This results in a much
more varied results list. For example, a search on Smi% will return a
list containing Smothers, Smith, Smelley, Smithfield and many others
depending on what is your database.

The bottom line in searching with wildcards: '\*' is more exact while
'%' searches for like terms.

`Title Searching <#titlesearchingfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Why does my Zebra title search for 'Help' not turn up 'The
help' in the first pages of results?

**Answer**: When doing a title search, you actually want to search for
the title (i.e., 'the help' rather than just 'help'), and it will bubble
right up to the top. If you're just searching for 'help' then the
relevance ranking is going to affect the results you see.

When it comes to relevance in Zebra, here's what's happening. First, the
search is done. If you search for the title "help", then any title that
has "help" in it comes back. Then from those records, separately, it
does relevance on the \*whole\* record. The more your word appears, the
more relevant, and some MARC tags are worth more points than others. So
a self-help book with 505 notes where "help" appears a \*lot\* will be
at the top, regardless of keyword or title.

But when you add a \*second word\*, that helps it figure things out, as
it's weighing the relevance of both words and the phrase. Because of the
way relevance works, if you search "the help", then "the help" or "the
help I need" are more relevant than "the way to help", because they
appear together in order. Likewise, "help the girl" would be lower
relevance, because it's out of order, and "help for the homeless" would
be lower still, as they're out of order, and apart.

The moral of the story is that single word searches, particularly on
common words, will always struggle a bit; it can't evaluate relevance
well, because you've not given it enough input.

`Enhanced Content <#enhancedcontentfaq>`__
------------------------------------------

`FRBRizing Content <#frbrfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question:**\ At our public library we are running a Koha installation
and we've tried to turn on all the nice functionalities in Koha such as
the frbrising tool, but do not get the same result as Nelsonville public
library.

**Answer:**\ In fact, this feature is quite tricky to make that right.
First it looks at XISBN service. And then search in your database for
that ISBN. So both XISBN and your internal ISBN (in biblio table) have
to be normalized. You could therefore use the script
misc/batchupdateISBNs.pl (it removes all the - in your local ISBNs)

`Amazon <#amzfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`All Amazon Content <#amazonfaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: I have all of the Amazon preferences turned on and have
entered both of my keys, but none of the content appears in my system,
why is that?

**Answer**: Amazon's API checks your server time on all requests and if
your server time is not set properly requests will be denied. To resolve
this issue be sure to set your system time appropriately. Once that
change in made Amazon content should appear immediately.

On Debian the the command is *date -s "2010-06-30 17:21"* (with the
proper date and time for your timezone).

`System Administration <#systemfaq>`__
--------------------------------------

`Errors in Zebra Cron <#zebracronfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: I am noticing some errors in the
koha-zebradaemon-output.log file. When new records are added it takes a
bit longer to index than we think they should. Running rebuild zebra is
often faster. Zebra ends up indexing and search works, but I am
concerned about the errors. Any ideas?

**Answer**: Rebuild\_zebra.pl -r deletes all of the files in the Zebra
db directories (such as reci-0.mf) and then recreates them. Thus,
permissions will be lost, and the files will be owned by the user who
ran rebuild\_zebra.pl. If one rebuilds the zebra indexes as root, the
daemons, which typically run under the user Koha, will not be able to
update the indexes. Thus, it's important then that the zebra rebuilds
are put in the cronjob file of the user Koha, and not root. Also
important is that other users, such as root, don't manually execute
rebuilds.

If one desires that another user be able to execute rebuild\_zebra.pl,
he should be given the permission to execute 'sudo -u Koha
.../rebuild\_zebra.pl,' (if you want to do this, you also have to edit
the sudoers file to pass the PERL5LIB variable with the env\_keep option
as by default sudo strips away almost all environment variables). Or, as
root user, one can use a simple 'su koha' and then the rebuild\_zebra.pl
command.

I've also tried to set the sticky bit on rebuild\_zebra.pl, but for
whatever reason it didn't seem to work due to some problem with the
PERL5LIB variable that I wasn't able to figure. That seems to me the
easiest thing to do, if anybody has any idea how to make it work. If it
worked and were the default, I think it would help folks to avoid a
great deal of the problems that come up with zebra.

`Making Z39.50 Target Public <#publicztarget>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Could someone tell me the exact steps I need to take to
configure Zebra to expose my Koha 3 db as a public Z39.50 service?

**Answer**: Edit the KOHA\_CONF file that your Koha is using. Uncomment
the publicserver line like:

<!-- <listen id="publicserver" >tcp:@:9999</listen> -->

to be:

<listen id="publicserver" >tcp:@:9999</listen>

Then restart zebasrv and connect on the port specified (9999).

`Shelving Location Authorized Values <#authvalfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: When editing an item, the new shelving location I created
is not showing up by default in the items where I assigned it to.

**Answer**: This is because you created the new shelving location with a
code value of 0 (zero) Just FYI the system interprets authorized values
of 0 as equaling a null so when you edit a record in cataloging where
the authorized value in a field was assigned where the code was 0, the
value displays as null in the item editor (or MARC editor) instead of
the value the library meant it to be.

`Why do I need Authorized Values? <#whyauthvals>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Why would I want to define authorized values for MARC
tags?

**Answer**: Authorized Values create a 'controlled vocabulary' for your
staff. As an example, let us assume that your Koha installation is used
by several libraries, and you use MARC 21. You might want to restrict
the 850a MARC subfield to the institution codes for just those
libraries. In that case, you could define an authorized values category
(perhaps called "INST") and enter the institution codes as the
authorized values for that category.

    **Note**

    Koha automatically sets up authorized value categories for your item
    types and branch codes, and you can link these authorized values to
    MARC subfields when you set up your MARC tag structure.

`How do I clean up the sessions table? <#sessionstblfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Is there a periodic job that can be run to cull old
sessions from the table? We don't want to backup all the useless session
data every night.

**Answer**: You can run `cleanup database cron job <#cleandbcron>`__.

Or just before doing a backup command (mysqldump), you can truncate
session table:  

::

    mysql -u<kohauser -p<password <koha-db-name -e 'TRUNCATE TABLE sessions'

`Hardware <#hardwarefaq>`__
---------------------------

`Barcode Scanners <#barcodefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What barcode scanners have been known to work with Koha?

**Answer**: The simple rule of thumb is, does it act like a keyboard
device?, if so, it will work. (i.e. can you take the scanner, scan a
barcode and have it show up in a text editor, if so, it will work.)

The main points to check are that it connects to your PC conveniently
(can be USB or "keyboard wedge" which means it connects in line with the
keyboard, which is useful with older computers), and that it scans the
barcode type that you are using.

It is a good idea to test some 'used' barcodes if you have any, to see
whether the scanner can read scuffed or slightly wrinkled ones
successfully. Most scanners are capable of reading several barcode types
- there are many, and the specification should list the ones it can
read. You may need to adjust settings slightly, such as prefix and
suffix characters, or whether you want to send an 'enter' character or
not.

One more tip - some can be set 'always on' and may come with a stand,
some have triggers under the handle, some have buttons on top, some are
held like a pen. Think about the staff working with the hardware before
choosing, as a button in the wrong place can be very awkward to use.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  POS-X receipt printer

-  Star Micronics printer (exact model unknown) with a generic/plain
   text driver.

-  Star SP2000 (Nelsonville)

-  Star TSP-100 futurePRINT (Geauga)

   -  "I know there have been a lot of questions on receipt printers so
      I thought I'd pass on my findings. We have been testing the Star
      TSP-100 futurePRINT. I found this print to be VERY easy to
      configure for Koha. I was even able to customize the print job by
      adding our system logo (a .gif) to the top of every receipt. Also
      with a bitmap created in Paint was able to add a message at the
      bottom of each receipt with the contact information, hours and
      website for the library that the materials were checked out at."

`Braille Support <#braillefaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: Are there any braille embosser or printer which has
inbuilt braille converter and it is accessible with UNIX environment?

**Answer**: You may want to look into BRLTTY
(http://www.emptech.info/product_details.php?ID=1232).

Extending Koha
==============

`Amazon lookup script for Koha libraries <#amzlookup>`__
--------------------------------------------------------

We order most of our materials from Amazon, so I've been looking for a
convenient way to tell if a book under consideration is in our catalog
already.

Greasemonkey & a custom user script fit the bill nicely:

-  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748

-  http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/56847

A few caveats:

-  Like most scripts, this one was designed to work with Firefox; I
   haven't explored getting it to work with other browsers.

-  I'm not a JavaScript programmer -- this was adapted from others'
   work. Just a few lines would have to be changed to get the script to
   work with your catalog.

-  It depends on the existence of ISBN for the item in question, so
   movies, older books, etc. would not work.

Others have added all sorts of bells & whistles: XISBN lookups to search
for related titles, custom messages based on the status of items (on
order, on hold, etc.), ... just search the UserScripts site for Amazon +
library. For a later date!

`Keyword Clouds <#extendkeywordclouds>`__
-----------------------------------------

In addition to the traditional tag cloud available in Koha, there is a
way to generate clouds for popular subjects within Koha.

The `Author/Subject Cloud cron job <#keywordclouds>`__ is used to help
with this process. This cron job sends its output to files.

-  /home/koha/mylibrary/koharoot/koha-tmpl/cloud-author.html

-  /home/koha/yourlibrary/koharoot/koha-tmpl/cloud-subject.html

This means that you can produce clouds for authors, collective author,
all kind of subjects, classifications, etc. And since it works on zebra
indexes, it is quick, even on large DBs. Tags clouds are sent to files.
It's up to library webmaster to deal with those files in order to
include them in `OPACMainUserBlock <#OpacMainUserBlock>`__, or include
them into their library CMS.

Some libraries even send the file into a Samba shared folder where
webmaster take them, eventually clean them a little bit before
integrating them into navigation widgets or pages.

`Newest Titles Pulldown <#newtitlesoption>`__
---------------------------------------------

Often we want to add a way for our patrons to do searches for the newest
items. In this example I'll show you how to create a pull down menu of
the newest items by item type. These tips will work (with a couple
changes) for collection codes or shelving locations as well.

First, it's important to note that every link in Koha is a permanent
link. This means if I do a search for everything of a specific item type
sorted by the acquisitions date and bookmark that URL, whenever I click
it I'll see the newest items of that type on the first few pages of the
results.

I took this knowledge and wrote a form takes this functionality in to
consideration. It basically just does a search of your Koha catalog for
a specific item type and sorts the results by acquisitions date.

The first thing I did was write a MySQL statement to generate a list of
item types for me - why copy and paste when you can use the power of
MySQL?

::

    select concat('<option value=\"mc-itype:', itemtype, '\">',description,'</option>') from itemtypes

The above looks at the itemtypes table and slaps the necessary HTML
around each item type for me. I then exported that to CSV and opened it
in my text editor and added the other parts of the form.

::

    <p><strong>New Items</strong></p>
    <p><form name="searchform" method="get" action="/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl">
    <input name="idx" value="kw" type="hidden">
    <input name="sort_by" value="acqdate_dsc" type="hidden">
    <input name="do" value="OK" type="hidden">
    <select name="limit" onchange="this.form.submit()">
    <option>-- Please choose --</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:BOOK">Book</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:BOOKCD">Book on CD</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:DVD">DVD</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:LRG_PRINT">Large print book</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:MAGAZINE">Magazine</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:NEWSPAPER">Newspaper</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:VIDEO">Videocassette</option>
    </select>
    </form>
    </p>

Now, what does all of that mean? The important bits are these:

First the starting of the form.

::

    <p><form name="searchform" method="get" action="/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl">

This tells the browser to take any value selected and put it at the end
of this http://YOURSITE/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl. If you want to
embed this form on your library website (and not on your OPAC) you can
put the full OPAC URL in there.

Next, there is a hidden value that is telling the search to sort by
acquisitions date descending (newest items at the top):

::

    <input name="sort_by" value="acqdate_dsc" type="hidden">

And finally you have an option for each item type you want people to
search.

::

    <option value="mc-itype:BOOK">Book</option>

These options each include the string "mc-itype:" which tells Koha to do
an item type search.

Once you have all of that in place you can copy and paste the form to
somewhere on your OPAC. The `Farmington Public Libraries
OPAC <http://catalog.farmingtonlibraries.org>`__ has a few examples of
this on the left.

`Cataloging and Searching by Color <#colorsearch>`__
----------------------------------------------------

One of the icon sets installed in Koha includes a series of colors. This
set can be used to catalog and search by color if you'd like. This guide
will walk you use changing collection code to color in Koha so that you
can do this.

The following SQL could be used to add these colors to the CCODE
authorized value category in a batch. If you wanted to use these colors
for another authorized value you'd have to edit this to use that
category:

::

        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','000000','Black','','colors/000000.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','66cc66','Bright Green','','colors/66cc66.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','99cc33','Olive','','colors/99cc33.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','3333cc','Dark Blue','','colors/3333cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','006600' ,'Dark Green','','colors/006600.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','6600cc','Plum','','colors/6600cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','6666cc','Purple','','colors/6666cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','9999cc','Light Purple','','colors/9999cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','660000' ,'Burgundy','','colors/660000.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','663333' ,'Brown','','colors/663333.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','990000' ,'Red','','colors/990000.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','996633' ,'Tan','','colors/996633.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','999999' ,'Gray','','colors/999999.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc66cc','Pink','','colors/cc66cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc99cc','Bubble Gum','','colors/cc99cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc3333' ,'Orange','','colors/cc3333.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc6666' ,'Peach','','colors/cc6666.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc9999' ,'Rose','','colors/cc9999.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cccc00' ,'Gold','','colors/cccc00.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','ffff33' ,'Yellow','','colors/ffff33.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','ffffcc','Cream','','colors/ffffcc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','ffffff','White','','colors/ffffff.png');

If you would like to choose the colors manually you can do that via the
`Authorized Values <#authorizedvalues>`__ administration area.

Colors for CCODE
|image1118|

Next you'll want to `update the frameworks <#marcbibframeworks>`__ so
that the 952$8 (if you're using collection code) label to says Color.

Once you have that in place you can start to catalog items by color.

Finally you'll want to add the following JQuery to your preferences so
that it will relabel 'Collection' to 'Color'

`IntranetUserJS <#intranetuserjs>`__

::

    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#advsearch-tab-ccode a:contains('Collection')").text("Color");
        $("#holdings th:contains('Collection')").text("Color");
        });

`OPACUserJS <#opacuserjs>`__

::

    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#advsearch-tab-ccode a:contains('Collection')").text("Color");
        $('#item_ccode').text("Color");
        });

Koha and Your Website
=====================

This appendix will include tips for integrating Koha in to your library
website.

`Koha search on your site <#embedsearch>`__
-------------------------------------------

Often you'll want to add a Koha search box to your library website. To
do so, just copy and paste the following code in to your library website
and update the YOURCATALOG bit with your catalog's URL and you're set to
go.

::

    <form name="searchform" method="get" action="http://YOURCATLOG/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl" id="searchform">
    <input id="transl1" name="q" type="text"><p>

GNU General Public License version 3
====================================

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

**Preamble**

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

**0. Definitions.**

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
item in the list meets this criterion.

**1. Source Code.**

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major
Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work,
or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
those activities. However, it does not include the work's System
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes
interface definition files associated with source files for the work,
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms
and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

**2. Basic Permissions.**

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
it unnecessary.

**3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.**

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

**4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.**

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

**5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.**

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
   and giving a relevant date.

b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
   under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
   requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
   notices".

c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
   anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
   therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
   terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how
   they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the
   work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if
   you have separately received it.

d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
   Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
   interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
   need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond
what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
aggregate.

**6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.**

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
   used for software interchange.

b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
   offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
   offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
   anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
   Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
   covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
   used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
   reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or
   (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
   no charge.

c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
   is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
   received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
   subsection 6b.

d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
   (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
   further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
   Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy
   the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
   on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that
   supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
   directions next to the object code saying where to find the
   Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
   Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
   available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
   inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
   the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
   subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used"
refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless
of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the
particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses,
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the
product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been
installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code
form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking,
reading or copying.

**7. Additional Terms.**

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
   of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
   author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
   Notices displayed by works containing it; or

c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
   requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
   reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
   authors of the material; or

e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
   names, trademarks, or service marks; or

f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
   by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
   contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
   liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
   licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not
survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
requirements apply either way.

**8. Termination.**

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

**9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.**

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

**10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.**

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale,
or importing the Program or any portion of it.

**11. Patents.**

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work
and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
available to you under applicable patent law.

**12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.**

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
Program.

**13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work,
and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination
as such.

**14. Revised Versions of this License.**

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

**15. Disclaimer of Warranty.**

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**16. Limitation of Liability.**

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.**

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.

**END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

**How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs**

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

::

    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
    Copyright (C) year name of author

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

::

    program Copyright (C) year name of author
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.


The hypothetical commands \`\ ``show w``' and \`\ ``show c``' should
show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course,
your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you
would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the
GNU GPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first,
please read http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.
