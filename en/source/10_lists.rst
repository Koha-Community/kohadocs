Once you have selected the records to merge together the process is the
same as if you had chosen to `merge via cataloging <#mergebibs>`__.

`Cart <#cart>`__
----------------

The cart is a temporary holding place for items in the OPAC and/or staff
client. The cart will be emptied once the session is ended (by closing
the browser or logging out). The cart is best used for performing batch
operations (holds, printing, emailing) or for getting a list of items to
be printed or emailed to yourself or a patron.

If you would like to enable the cart in the staff client, you need to
set the `intranetbookbag <#intranetbookbag>`__ system preference to
'Show.' To add things to the cart, search the catalog and select the
items you would like added to your cart and choose 'Cart' from the 'Add
to' menu
