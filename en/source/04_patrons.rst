Patrons
=======

Before importing and/or adding patrons be sure to set up your :ref:`patron
categories <patron-categories-label>`.

.. _add-a-new-patron-label:

Add a new patron
------------------------------------

Patrons are added by going to the 'Patrons' module.

-  *Get there:* Patrons

Once there you can add a new patron.

-  Click 'New patron'

   Choose patron type
   |image407|

-  The fields that appear on the patron add form can be controlled by
   editing the :ref:`BorrowerUnwantedField` system
   preference.

-  First enter the identifying information regarding your patron

   Add Patron Form
   |image408|

   -  Required fields are defined in the
      :ref:`BorrowerMandatoryField` system
      preference

   -  Salutation is populated by the
      :ref:`BorrowersTitles` system preference

   -  **Note**

          If you'd like to prevent full names from printing on
          :ref:`slips <notices-&-slips-label>` and you're not using the Initials or
          Other name fields for anything else, you can use them for
          shortened versions of the name to then be printed on the slip.

          For example:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole C.
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: NCE

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>> instead of the full name (NCE).

          Or you could do something like this:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: E

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>>, <<borrowers.firstname>> instead of the
          full name (E, Nicole).

-  Next enter the contact information

   Patron Contact Information
   |image409|

   -  For contact information, note that the primary phone and email
      addresses are the ones that appear on notices and slips printed
      during circulation (receipts, transfer slips and hold slips). The
      primary email is also the one that overdue notices and other
      messages go to.

-  If this patron is a child, you will be asked to attach the child
   patron to an adult patron

   Guarantor Linking
   |image410|

   -  Click 'Set to Patron' to search your system for an existing patron

   -  If the Guarantor is not in the system, you can enter the first and
      last name in the fields available

   -  The relationships are set using the
      :ref:`borrowerRelationship` system preference

-  If this patron is a professional, you will be asked to attach the
   patron to an organizational patron

   Organization Linking
   |image411|

   -  Click 'Set to Patron to search your system for an existing patron

-  Each patron can have an alternate contact

   Alternate Contact
   |image412|

   -  An alternate contact could be a parent or guardian. It can also be
      used in academic settings to store the patron's home address.

-  The library management section includes values that are used within
   the library

   Library Management
   |image413|

   -  The card number field is automatically calculated if you have the
      :ref:`autoMemberNum` system preference set that way

      -  **Note**

             For a newly installed system this preference will start at
             1 and increment by 1 each time after. To have it start with
             the starting number of your barcodes, enter the first
             barcode by hand in the patron record and save the patron.
             After that the field will increment that number by 1.

   -  If you accidentally chose the wrong patron category at the
      beginning you can fix that here

   -  Sort 1 and 2 are used for statistical purposes within your library

-  Next, the Library Setup section includes additional library settings

   Library set-up options
   |image414|

   -  The registration date will automatically be filled in with today's
      date

   -  If your patron cards expire (based on your :ref:`patron category
      settings <patron-categories-label>`) the Expiry date will automatically be
      calculated

   -  The OPAC Note is a note for the patron - it will appear in the
      OPAC on the patron's record

   -  The Circulation Note is meant solely for your library staff and
      will appear when the circulation staff goes to check an item out
      to the patron

      Sample Circulation Note
      |image415|

   -  The Staff/OPAC asks for the username and password to be used by
      the patron (and/or staff member) to log into their account in the
      OPAC and for staff to log in to the staff client.

      -  Staff will only be able to use this log in info to log in to
         the staff client if they have the :ref:`necessary
         permissions <patron-permissions-label>`.

-  If you have set :ref:`additional patron
   attributes <patron-attribute-types-label>` up, these will appear next

   Additional Patron Attributes
   |image416|

-  Finally, if you have
   :ref:`EnhancedMessagingPreferences` set
   to 'allow,' you can choose the messaging preferences for this patron.

   Patron Messaging Settings
   |image417|

   -  These notices are:

      -  Advanced notice : A notice in advance of the patron's items
         being due (The patron can choose the number of days in advance)

      -  Item checkout : A notice that lists all the of the items the
         patron has just checked out and/or renewed, this is an
         electronic form of the checkout receipt

      -  Hold filled : A notice when you have confirmed the hold is
         waiting for the patron

      -  Item due : A notice on the day and item is due back at the
         library

      -  Item check-in : A notice that lists all the of the items the
         patron has just checked in

   -  Patrons can choose to receive their notices as a digest by
      checking the 'Digest only?' box along with the delivery method. A
      digest is a combination of all the messages of that type (so all
      items due in 3 days in one email) in to one email instead of
      multiple emails for each alert.

   -  **Important**

          These preferences will override any you set via the :ref:`patron
          categories <adding-a-patron-category-label>`

   -  **Important**

          These preference can be altered by the patron via the OPAC

-  Once finished, click 'Save'

If the system suspects this patron is a duplicate of another it will
warn you.

Patron Duplicate Suspected
|image418|

    **Note**

    A duplicate patron is detected if first and last names match and
    there is no date of birth populated or if first name, last name and
    date of birth fields are all populated. If two patrons have matching
    names, but one has a date of birth and the other does not they will
    not match as duplicates.

If you have set a minimum or upper age limit on the patron category and
are requiring that the birth date be filled in, Koha will warn you if
the patron you're adding is too old or young for the patron category you
have selected:

.. _add-a-staff-patron-label:

Add a Staff Patron
----------------------------------------

All staff members must be entered into Koha as patrons of the 'Staff'
type. Follow the steps in :ref:`Add a Patron <add-a-new-patron-label>` to add a
staff member. To give the staff member permissions to access the staff
client, follow the steps in :ref:`Patron Permissions`

    **Important**

    Remember to assign your staff secure usernames and passwords since
    these will be used to log into the staff client.

.. _add-a-statistical-patron-label:

Add a Statistical Patron
----------------------------------------------

One way to track use of in house items is to "check out" the materials
to a statistical patron. The "check out" process doesnâ€™t check the book
out, but instead tracks an in house use of the item. To use this method
for tracking in house use you first will need a :ref:`patron
category <patron-categories-label>` set up for your Statistical patron.

In House Patron Category
|image420|

Next, you will need to create a new patron of the statistical type

New In House Patron
|image421|

Next, follow the steps put forth in the ':ref:`Add a new
Patron <add-a-new-patron-label>`' section of this manual. Since this patron is
not a real person, simply fill in the required fields, the correct
library and nothing else.

To learn about other methods of tracking in house use visit the
:ref:`Tracking inhouse use <tracking-in-house-use-label>` section of this manual.

.. _duplicate-a-patron-label:

Duplicate a Patron
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes when you're adding a new family to your system you don't want
to type the contact information over and over. Koha allows for you to
duplicate a patron and change only the parts you want to (or need to)
change.

-  Open the patron you want to use as your base (the patron you want to
   duplicate information from)

-  Click the 'Duplicate' button at the top of their record

   The Duplicate Button is the 3rd one in
   |image422|

-  All of the fields with the exception of first name, card number,
   username and password have been duplicated. Fill in the missing
   pieces and click 'Save'

   Duplicating Patron Form
   |image423|

   -  **Note**

          Clicking in a field that is already populated with data will
          clear that field of all information (making it easier for you
          to type in something different)

-  You will be brought to your new patron

   Newly created patron
   |image424|

.. _add-patron-images-label:

Add Patron Images
----------------------------------------

If you would like you can add patron images to help identify patrons. To
enable this feature you must first set the
:ref:`patronimages` preference to 'Allow'.

If the preference is set to 'Allow' you will see a placeholder image
under the patron's name and box to upload a patron image below the basic
contact information.

Add patron image
|image425|

In the 'Upload Patron Image' box click 'Browse' to find the image on
your computer and 'Upload' to load the image on to the patron record.

    is recommended that the image be 200x300 pixels, but smaller images
    will work as well.

   -  This form will not appear if you have the
      :ref:`patronimages` system preference to not allow
      patron images

   -  To add patron images in bulk, use the :ref:`Upload Patron
      Images <upload-patron-images-label>` Tool

-  Patrons can also be blocked from checking items out by setting Patron
   Flags

   Patron Warning Flags
   |image431|

   -  If you would like your circulation staff to confirm a patron's
      address before checking items out to the patron, you can see the
      'Gone no Address' flag

      Patron's address in doubt
      |image432|

   -  If the patron reports that they have lost their card you can set
      the 'Lost Card' flag to prevent someone else from using that card
      to check items out

      Patron lost card
      |image433|

   -  If you would like to bar a patron from the library you can add a
      manual restriction

      Add manual restriction
      |image434|

      -  **Note**

             This flag can automatically be set with the :ref:`Overdue/Notice
             Status Triggers <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`

   -  If you enter in a date and/or note related to the restriction you
      will see that in the restricted message as well

      Restricted until message
      |image435|

-  Children patrons do not become adults automatically in Koha unless
   you have :ref:`Juvenile to Adult cron job <update-child-to-adult-patron-type-label>` running. To
   upgrade a child patron to and adult patron category manually go to
   the 'More' menu and choose 'Update Child to Adult Patron'
