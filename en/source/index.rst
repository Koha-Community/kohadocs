Introduction
============

`Koha Basics <#introbasics>`__
------------------------------

Koha is the first free and open source software library automation
package (ILS). Development is sponsored by libraries of varying types
and sizes, volunteers, and support companies from around the world.

Learn more about Koha by visiting the official Koha website:
http://koha-community.org

`Koha Recommendations <#introrecommend>`__
------------------------------------------

Full system recommendations can be found on the official Koha wiki along
with the developer documentation: http://wiki.koha-community.org

When working in the Koha staff client it is strongly recommended that
you use the Firefox browser. Koha's staff client is not supported in
Internet Explorer and has not yet been fully optimized for Google
Chrome.

`Using this Manual <#usingmanual>`__
------------------------------------

This manual is always changing and suggestions for edits can be sent to
the Documentation Manager via the `DOCS mailing
list <https://lists.koha-community.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/koha-docs>`__.
The manual is organized by Koha module. At the start of most sections
(and throughout) you will find 'Get there' tips. These lines tell you
how to get to the section in Koha.

For example: *Get there:* More > Administration > Global System
Preferences

Get there: More > Administration > Global System Preferences

The instruction tells you where to find the necessary menu option at the
top of the Koha staff client.

Links will be found throughout the manual to other sections in the
manual and images will depict what should be seen on the screen.

The manual can be searched using the custom Google search on the `Koha
Documentation <http://koha-community.org/documentation/>`__ page.

`Contributing to the Manual <#contributing>`__
----------------------------------------------

This manual is an ever-changing document and edits to the manual are
welcome at any time.

The `Koha Manual <http://manual.koha-community.org/>`__ is managed by
the Documentation Manager, but that doesn't mean we can't all
participate in making the best manual possible.

The manual is stored in git at:
http://git.koha-community.org/gitweb/?p=kohadocs.git;a=summary

To edit the manual we recommend `oXygen <http://www.oxygenxml.com>`__ or
other XML/DocBook editor. We ask that every chapter and section have an
ID tag associated with it to enable permanent linking and searching.

Patches to the manual should be emailed to the `DOCS mailing
list <https://lists.koha-community.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/koha-docs>`__
and will be reviewed by the Documentation Manager before inclusion.

Administration
==============

`Global System Preferences <#globalsysprefs>`__
-----------------------------------------------

Global system preferences control the way your Koha system works in
general. Set these preferences before anything else in Koha.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Global System Preferences

Global System Preferences Link and Search
|image0|

System preferences can be searched (using any part of the preference
name or description) using the search box on the 'Administration' page
or the search box at the top of each system preferences page.

Preferences search at the top of System Preference page
|image1|

When editing preferences a '(modified)' tag will appear next to items
you change until you click the 'Save All' button:

After editing TagsModeration the '(modified)' label appears
|image2|

After saving your preferences you'll get a confirmation message telling
you what preferences were saved:

Preference save confirmation message
|image3|

Each section of preferences can be sorted alphabetically by clicking the
small down arrow to the right of the word 'Preference' in the header
column

Sort option at the top right of each section of preferences
|image4|

If the preference refers to monetary values (like
`maxoutstanding <#maxoutstanding>`__) the currency displayed will be the
default you set in your `Currency and Exchange
Rate <#currexchangeadmin>`__ administration area. In the examples to
follow they will all read USD for U.S. Dollars.

    **Important**

    For libraries systems with unique URLs for each site the system
    preference can be overridden by editing your koha-http.conf file
    this has to be done by a system administrator or someone with access
    to your system files. For example if all libraries but one want to
    have search terms highlighted in results you set the
    OpacHighlightedWords preference to 'Highlight' then edit the
    koha-http.conf for the library that wants this turned off by adding
    'SetEnv OVERRIDE\_SYSPREF\_OpacHighlightedWords "0"'. After
    restarting the web server that one library will no longer see
    highlighted terms. Consult with your system administrator for more
    information.

`Acquisitions <#acqprefs>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Get there:* More > Administration > Global System Preferences >
Acquisitions

Values:

-  cataloging a record

-  placing an order

-  receiving an order

Description:

-  This preference lets you decide when you'd like to create an item
   record in Koha. If you choose to add an item record when 'placing an
   order' then you will enter item information in as you place records
   in your basket. If you choose to add the item when 'receiving an
   order' you will be asked for item record information when you're
   receiving orders in acquisitions. If you choose to add the item when
   'cataloging a record' then item records will not be created in
   acquisitions at all, you will need to go to the cataloging module to
   add the items.

`AcqEnableFiles <#AcqEnableFiles>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't

Asks: \_\_\_ enable the ability to upload and attach arbitrary files to
invoices.

Values:

Asks: Upon cancelling a receipt, update the item's subfields if they
were created when placing an order (e.g. o=5\|a="bar foo""). \_\_\_

Description:

-  This preference is used in conjunction with the
   `AcqItemSetSubfieldsWhenReceived <#AcqItemSetSubfieldsWhenReceived>`__
   preference. If you have the system set to enter default values when
   you receive you will want to have those values revert back if reeipt
   is cancelled. This preference allows you to do that.

`AcqItemSetSubfieldsWhenReceived <#AcqItemSetSubfieldsWhenReceived>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Upon receiving items, update their subfields if they were created
when placing an order (e.g. o=5\|a="foo bar"). \_\_\_

Description:

-  This preference allows you to set default values for items that you
   receive via acquisitions. Enter the data as subfield=value and split
   your values with a bar ( \| ). For example you can remove the Ordered
   status on the item automatically when you receive it just by entering
   7=0 in this preference. That will set the Not for Loan status
   (subfield 7) to 0 which is available.

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: created by staff member

Asks: Show baskets \_\_\_

Values:

-  When in acquisitions this preference allows you to control whose
   baskets you can see when looking at a vendor. The default value of
   'created by staff member' makes it so that you only see the baskets
   you created. Choosing to see baskets 'from staff member's branch'
   will show you the baskets created by anyone at the branch you're
   logged in at. Finally, you can choose to set this preference to show
   you all baskets regardless of who created it ('in system, regardless
   of owner). Regardless of which value you choose for this preference,
   superlibrarians can see all baskets created in the system.

`AcqWarnOnDuplicateInvoice <#AcqWarnOnDuplicateInvoice>`__

Description:

-  This preference will allow the library to define a default Goods and
   Services Tax rate. The default of value of 0 will disable this
   preference.

   to use when `ordering from a staged file <#orderfromstagedfile>`__ in
   acquisitions. You can use the following fields: price, quantity,
   budget\_code, discount, sort1, sort2.

   For example:

   ::

       price: 947$a|947$c
       quantity: 969$h

items, must be valid SQL fields of
`items <http://schema.koha-community.org/tables/items.html>`__ table)

Description:

-  If this preference is left blank when adding items in acquisitions
   there will be no check for uniqueness. This means that a duplicate
   barcode can be created in acquisitions which will cause errors later
   when checking items in and out.

   will be sent when the value level is set at 2, some detail will be
   sent when the value is set at 1, and only a basic error message will
   display when the value is set at 0. This setting is especially
   important when a system is new and the administration is interested
   in working out the bugs (errors or problems) quickly. Having detailed
   error messages makes quick fixes more likely in problem areas.

`DefaultToLoggedInLibraryCircRules <#DefaultToLoggedInLibraryCircRules>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: all libraries

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is the default 'From' address for emails unless there is one for
the particular branch, and is referred to when an internal error occurs.

Asks: Use \_\_\_ as the email address for the administrator of Koha.

Description:

-  This preference allows one email address to be used in warning
   messages set to the OPAC. If no email address is set for the branch
   this address will receive messages from patrons regarding
   modification requests, purchase suggestions, and questions or
   information regarding overdue notices. It is recommended that a email
   address that can be accessed by multiple staff members be used for

-  Shows

-  Don't show

Description:

-  This preference allows the system administrator to determine if users
   will be able to set and see an `item type icon <#itemtypeadmin>`__
   the catalog on both the OPAC and the Staff Client. The images will
   display in both the OPAC and the Staff Client/Intranet. If images of
   item types are disabled, text labels for item types will still appear
   in the OPAC and Staff Client.

`ReplytoDefault <#ReplytoDefault>`__

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Use \_\_\_ as the email address set as the return path, if you
leave this empty the KohaAdminEmailAddress will be used.

Description:

-  The return path is the email address that bounces will be delivered
   to. By default bounced notices will go to the `library email

Asks: \_\_\_ staff and patrons to create and view saved lists of books.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't Allow

Description:

-  This preference controls whether the lists functionality will be

   allow" then no one will be able to save items to public or private
   lists.

`Login options <#adminprefslogin>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These preferences are related to logging into your Koha system

`AutoLocation <#AutoLocation>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't require

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to log in from a computer in the IP address range
specified by their library (if any).

-  Set IP address range in the library administration area

   -  *Get there:* More > Administration > Basic Parameters > `Libraries
      & Groups <#libsgroups>`__

Values:

-  Don't require

-  Require

Description:

-  This preference protects the system by blocking unauthorized users
   from accessing the staff client program and settings. Authorized and
   unauthorized users are determined by their computer's IP addresses.
   When the preference is set to 'Require', IP authorization is in
   effect and unauthorized IP addresses will be blocked. This means that
   staff cannot work from home unless their IP address has been
   authorized. When set to 'Don't require', anyone with a staff client
   login will have access no matter which IP address they are using.

`IndependentBranches <#IndependentBranches>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't prevent

Asks: \_\_\_ staff (but not superlibrarians) from modifying objects
(holds, items, patrons, etc.) belonging to other libraries.

Values:

-  Don't prevent

-  Prevent

Description:

-  This preference should only be used by library systems which are
   sharing a single Koha installation among multiple branches but are
   considered independent organizations, meaning they do not share
   material or patrons with other branches and do not plan to change
   that in the future. If set to 'Prevent' it increases the security
   between library branches by: prohibiting staff users from logging
   into another branch from within the staff client, filtering out
   patrons from patron searches who are not a part of the login branch
   conducting the search, limiting the location choices to the login
   branch when adding or modifying an item record, preventing users from
   other branch locations from placing holds or checking out materials
   from library branches other than their own, and preventing staff from
   editing item records which belong to other library branches. All of
   these security safeguards can be overridden only by the
   superlibrarian, the highest level of privileges.

    **Important**

    It is important that this value be set before going live and that it
    NOT be changed

`SessionRestrictionByIP <#SessionRestrictionByIP>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Enable

Asks: \_\_\_ check for change in remote IP address for session security.
Disable only when remote IP address changes frequently.

Values:

-  Disable

-  Enable

Description:

-  When this preference is set to 'Enable' Koha will log you out of the
   staff client if your IP address changes as a security measure. For
   some systems the IP address changes frequently so you'll want to set
   this preference to 'Disable' to prevent Koha from logging you out of
   the staff client every time that happens.

    **Important**

    This is meant to help those whose IP address changes several times
    during the day, setting this preference to 'Disable' is not
    recommended otherwise because it is removing important security
    features from your staff client.

`SessionStorage <#SessionStorage>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: in the MySQL database

Asks: Store login session information \_\_\_

Values:

-  as temporary files

-  in the MySQL database

-  in the PostgreSQL database

   -  **Important**

          PostgreSQL is not yet supported

Description:

-  This preference allows administrators to choose what format session
   data is stored in during web sessions.

`timeout <#timeout>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: 12000000

Asks: Automatically log out users after \_\_\_ seconds of inactivity.

Description:

-  This preference sets the length of time the Staff Client or OPAC
   accounts can be left inactive before re-logging in is necessary. The
   value of this preference is in seconds. At this time, the amount of
   time before a session times out must be the same for both the Staff
   Client and the OPAC.

`Mozilla Persona <#mozillapersona>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Persona <#persona>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ Mozilla persona for login.

Values:

-  Allow

   Persona login on OPAC
   |image13|

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  Mozilla Persona is an OpenID-like service that lets you log in to
   multiple websites with your Mozilla credentials. If you allow Persona
   log in for Koha then your patrons can log in to the OPAC using their
   Mozilla Persona. Learn more about Persona on the `official Mozilla
   site <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/>`__.

       **Important**

       For Persona log in to work you will need you
       `OPACBaseURL <#OPACBaseURL>`__ preference to be set correctly.

`Share anonymous usage statistics <#heaprefs>`__

   you choose to share your information, it will be published on the
   `Hea Koha community website <http://hea.koha-community.org>`__. This
   information is sent using the `Usage Sharing Cron

*Get there:* More > Administration > Global System Preferences >
Authorities

`General <#generalauthorities>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`AuthDisplayHierarchy <#AuthDisplayHierarchy>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't display

Asks: \_\_\_ broader term/narrower term hierarchies when viewing
authorities.

Values:

-  Display

   AuthDisplayHierarchy
   |image14|

-  Don't display

Description:

-  If your authority records includes 5xx fields with linked references
   to broader and/or narrower see also references this preference will
   turn on a display of those authorities at the top of the record.

`AutoCreateAuthorities <#AutoCreateAuthorities>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: do not generate

Asks: When editing records, \_\_\_ authority records that are missing.

Values:

-  do not generate

-  generate

    **Important**

    `BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__ must be set to
    "allow" for this to have any effect

Description:

-  When this and `BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__ are
   both turned on, automatically create authority records for headings
   that don't have any authority link when cataloging. When
   BiblioAddsAuthorities is on and AutoCreateAuthorities is turned off,
   do not automatically generate authority records, but allow the user
   to enter headings that don't match an existing authority. When
   BiblioAddsAuthorities is off, this has no effect.

`BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: allow

Asks: When editing records, \_\_\_ them to automatically create new
authority records if needed, rather than having to reference existing
authorities.

Values:

-  allow

   -  This setting allows you to type values in the fields controlled by
      authorities and then adds a new authority if one does not exist

-  don't allow

   -  This setting will lock the authority controlled fields, forcing
      you to search for an authority versus allowing you to type the
      information in yourself.

`dontmerge <#dontmerge>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't

Asks: \_\_\_ automatically update attached biblios when changing an
authority record.

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Description:

-  This preference tells Koha how to handle changes to your Authority
   records. If you edit an authority record and this preference is set
   to 'Do' Koha will immediately update all of the bib records linked to
   the authority with the new authority record's data. If this is set to
   "Don't" then Koha won't edit bib records when changes are made to
   authorities, rather, this is done later by the `merge\_authority.pl
   cronjob <#mergeauthcron>`__.

    **Important**

    If this is set to "Don't automatically update" you will need to ask
    your administrator to enable the `merge\_authority.pl
    cronjob <#mergeauthcron>`__.

`MARCAuthorityControlField008 <#MARCAuthorityControlField008>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: \|\| aca\|\|aabn \| a\|a d

Asks: Use the following text for the contents of MARC21 authority
control field 008 position 06-39 (fixed length data elements).

    **Important**

    Do not include the date (position 00-05) in this preference, Koha
    will calculate automatically and put that in before the values in
    this preference.

Description:

-  This preference controls the default value in the 008 field on
   Authority records. It does not effect bibliographic records.

`UNIMARCAuthorityField100 <#UNIMARCAuthorityField100>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: afrey50 ba0

Asks: Use the following text for the contents of UNIMARC authority field
100 position (fixed length data elements).

    **Important**

    Do not include the date (position 00-07) in this preference, Koha
    will calculate automatically and put that in before the values in
    this preference.

Description:

-  This preference controls the default value in the 100 field on
   Authority records cataloged in UNIMARC. It does not effect
   bibliographic records.

`UseAuthoritiesForTracings <#UseAuthoritiesForTracings>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ authority record numbers instead of text strings for
searches from subject tracings.

Values:

-  Don't use

   -  Search links look for subject/author keywords (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=su:Business%20networks)

-  Use

   -  Search links look for an authority record (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=an:354)

Description:

-  For libraries that have authority files, they may want to make it so
   that when a link to an authorized subject or author is clicked on the
   OPAC or staff client it takes the searcher only to a list of results
   with that authority record. Most libraries do not have complete
   authority files and so setting this preference to 'Don't use' will
   allow searchers to click on links to authors and subject headings and
   perform a keyword search against those fields, finding all possible
   relevant results instead.

`Linker <#linkerauthorities>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These preferences will control how Koha links bibliographic records to
authority records. All bibliographic records added to Koha after these
preferences are set will link automatically to authority records, for
records added before these preferences are set there is a script
(misc/link\_bibs\_to\_authorities.pl) that your system administrator can
run to link records together.

`CatalogModuleRelink <#CatalogModuleRelink>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ automatically relink headings that have previously been
linked when saving records in the cataloging module.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  Longtime users of Koha don't expect the authority and bib records to
   link consistently. This preference makes it possible to disable
   authority relinking in the cataloging module only (i.e. relinking is
   still possible if link\_bibs\_to\_authorities.pl is run). Note that
   though the default behavior matches the previous behavior of Koha
   (retaining links to outdated authority records), it does not match
   the intended behavior (updating biblio/authority link after
   bibliographic record is edited). Libraries that want the intended
   behavior of authority control rather than the way Koha used to handle
   linking should set CatalogModuleRelink to 'Do'. Once setting this to
   'Do' the following preferences can also be set.

`LinkerKeepStale <#LinkerKeepStale>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ keep existing links to authority records for headings where
the linker is unable to find a match.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  When set to 'Do', the linker will never remove a link to an authority
   record, though, depending on the value of
   `LinkerRelink <#LinkerRelink>`__, it may change the link.

`LinkerModule <#LinkerModule>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Default

Asks: Use the \_\_\_ linker module for matching headings to authority
records.

Values:

-  Default

   -  Retains Koha's previous behavior of only creating links when there
      is an exact match to one and only one authority record; if the
      `LinkerOptions <#LinkerOptions>`__ preference is set to
      'broader\_headings', it will try to link headings to authority
      records for broader headings by removing subfields from the end of
      the heading

-  First match

   -  Creates a link to the first authority record that matches a given
      heading, even if there is more than one authority record that
      matches

-  Last match

   -  Creates a link to the last authority record that matches a given
      heading, even if there is more than one record that matches

Description:

-  This preference tells Koha which match to use when searching for
   authority matches when saving a record.

`LinkerOptions <#LinkerOptions>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Set the following options for the authority linker \_\_\_

    **Important**

    This feature is experimental and shouldn't be used in a production
    environment until further expanded upon.

Description:

-  This is a pipe separated (\|) list of options. At the moment, the
   only option available is "broader\_headings." With this option set to
   "broader\_headings", the linker will try to match the following
   heading as follows:

   ::

       =600 10$aCamins-Esakov, Jared$xCoin collections$vCatalogs$vEarly works to 1800.

   First: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections--Catalogs--Early works
   to 1800

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections--Catalogs

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared--Coin collections

   Next: Camins-Esakov, Jared (matches! if a previous attempt had
   matched, it would not have tried this)

`LinkerRelink <#LinkerRelink>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Do

Asks: \_\_\_ relink headings that have previously been linked to
authority records.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  When set to 'Do', the linker will confirm the links for headings that
   have previously been linked to an authority record when it runs,
   correcting any incorrect links it may find. When set to 'Do not', any
   heading with an existing link will be ignored, even if the existing
   link is invalid or incorrect.

`Cataloging <#catprefs>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Get there:* More > Administration > Global System Preferences >
Cataloging

`Display <#catdisplayprefs>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`AcquisitionDetails <#AcquisitionDetails>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Display

Asks: \_\_\_ acquisition details on the biblio detail page.

Values:

-  Display

-  Don't display

Description:

-  This preference controls whether a tab will show on the detail page
   in the staff client that includes detailed acquisitions information
   for the title. This tab will include links to order information
   stored in the acquisitions module.AcquisitionDetails

`AuthoritySeparator <#authoritysep>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: --

Asks: Separate multiple displayed authors, series or subjects with
\_\_\_.

`hide\_marc <#hide_marc>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Display

Asks: \_\_\_ MARC tag numbers, subfield codes and indicators in MARC
views.

Values:

-  Display -- shows the tag numbers on the cataloging interface

   MARC editor with tags showing
   |image15|

-  Don't display -- shows just descriptive text when cataloging

   MARC editor without tags showing
   |image16|

`IntranetBiblioDefaultView <#IntranetBiblioDefaultView>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: ISBD form

Asks: By default, display biblio records in \_\_\_

Values:

-  ISBD form -- displays records in the staff client in the old card
   catalog format

   -  See `ISBD <#isbdpref>`__ preference for more information

-  Labelled MARC form -- displays records in the staff client in MARC
   with text labels to explain the different fields

-  MARC form -- displays records in the staff client in MARC

-  normal form -- visual display in the staff client (for the average
   person)

Description:

-  This setting determines the bibliographic record display when
   searching the catalog on the staff client. This setting does not
   affect the display in the OPAC which is changed using the
   `BiblioDefaultView <#BiblioDefaultView>`__ preference under the OPAC
   preference tab. This setting changes the look of the record when
   first displayed. The MARC and ISBD views can still be seen by
   clicking in the sidebar.

`ISBD <#isbdpref>`__
''''''''''''''''''''

Default: `MARC21 Default Appendix <#isbddefault>`__ or `UNIMARC Default
Appendix <#unimarcdefault>`__

Asks: Use the following as the ISBD template:

Description:

-  This determines how the ISBD information will display in the staff
   client. Elements in the list can be reordered to produce a different
   ISBD view. ISBD, the International Standard Bibliographic
   Description, was first introduced by IFLA (International Federation
   of Library Associations) in 1969 in order to provide guidelines for
   descriptive cataloging. The purpose of ISBD is to aid the
   international exchange of bibliographic records for a variety of
   materials.

`LabelMARCView <#LabelMARCView>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't

Asks: \_\_\_ collapse repeated tags of the same type into one tag entry.

Values:

-  Do -- will combine all identical tag numbers under one heading in the
   MARC view in the OPAC and Staff Client

   MARC View in the Staff Client with LabelMARCView set to Do
   |image17|

-  Don't -- will list all of the tags individually in the MARC view in
   the OPAC and Staff Client

   MARC View in the Staff Client with LabelMARCView set to Don't
   |image18|

`MergeReportFields <#MergeReportFields>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: \_\_\_ fields to display for deleted records after merge

Description:

-  When merging records together you can receive a report of the merge
   process once it's done, this preference lets you set the default
   values for this report.

Example: '001,245ab,600' displays:

-  value of 001

-  subfields a and b of fields 245

-  all subfields of fields 600

`NotesBlacklist <#NotesBlacklist>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Don't show these \_\_\_ note fields in title notes separator (OPAC
record details) and in the description separator (Staff client record
details).

Description:

-  This preference lets you define which of your note fields are hidden
   from the title notes (OPAC) and descriptions (Staff) tabs. Enter the
   values as a comma separated list. For example to hide the local note
   and the bibliography note in MARC21 enter 504, 590.

`OpacSuppression, OpacSuppressionByIPRange, OpacSuppressionRedirect, and OpacSuppressionMessage <#OpacSuppression>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

OpacSuppression Default: Don't hide

Asks: \_\_\_ items marked as suppressed from OPAC search results. Note
that you must have the Suppress index set up in Zebra and at least one
suppressed item, or your searches will be broken. Restrict the
suppression to IP adresses outside of the IP range \_\_\_ (Leave blank
if not used. Define a range like 192.168..) Redirect the opac detail
page for suppressed records to \_\_\_ Display the following message on
the redirect page for suppressed biblios \_\_\_.

OpacSuppression Values:

-  Don't hide

   -  Will show records in OPAC search results if they are marked
      suppressed

-  Hide

   -  Will not show records in OPAC search results if they're marked as
      suppressed

OpacSuppressionRedirect Values:

-  an explanatory page ('This record is blocked').

-  the 404 error page ('Not found').

Description:

-  These preferences control hiding of bibliographic records from
   display in the OPAC. Each bibliogrphic record you want to hide from
   the OPAC simply needs to have the value "1" in the field mapped with
   Suppress index (942$n field in MARC21, no official field in UNIMARC).
   The indexer then hides it from display in OPAC but will still display
   it in the Staff Client. If you want to further control suppression
   you can set an IP address range to still show suppressed items to.
   Define a range like 192.168.. If you don't want to limit suppression
   in this way, leave the IP field blank. You can also decide what the
   patrons will see in the OPAC when a title is suppressed by setting
   the OpacSuppressionRedirect and OpacSuppressionMessage preferences.
   You can either show the patron a 404 page if they try to see a
   suppressed record or you can create a custom page by entering the
   HTML in the OpacSuppressionMessage part of this preference.

       **Note**

       An `authorized value <#authorizedvalues>`__ for the MARC21 942$n
       field (or the equivalent UNIMARC field) should be set to
       eliminate errors. One example would be to create an authorized
       value titled SUPPRESS with a value of 0 for don't suppress and 1
       for suppress.

    **Important**

    If this preference is set to 'hide' and you have the 942n field set
    to 1, it will hide the entire bib record - not just an individual
    item.

    **Important**

    You must have the Suppress index set up in Zebra and at least one
    record with the value "1" in the field mapped with this index, or
    your searches will be completely broken in OPAC (you won't get any
    results at all).

    **Note**

    Suppressed records will show a note in the staff client indicating
    that they are suppressed from view in the OPAC.Suppressed in Staff

    This note can be styled by using the
    `IntranetUserCSS <#IntranetUserCSS>`__ preference to stand out more
    if you'd like.Style suppression note

`SeparateHoldings & SeparateHoldingsBranch <#SeparateHoldings>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

SeparateHoldings default: Don't separate

SeparateHoldingsBranch default: home library

Asks: \_\_\_ items display into two tabs, where the first tab contains
items whose \_\_\_ is the logged in user's library. The second tab will
contain all other items.

SeparateHoldings values:

-  Don't separate

-  Separate

SeparateHoldingsBranch values:

-  holding library

-  home library

Description:

-  This preference lets you decide if you would like to have the holding
   information on the bibliographic detail page in the staff client
   split in to multiple tabs. The default is to show all holdings on one
   tab.

   Separate holdings tabs
   |image19|

`URLLinkText <#URLLinkText>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Online Resource

Asks: Show \_\_\_ as the text of links embedded in MARC records.

Description:

-  If the 856 field does not have a subfield 3 or y defined, the OPAC
   will say 'Click here to access online.' If you would like the field
   to say something else enter that in this field.

`UseControlNumber <#UseControlNumber>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ record control number ($w subfields) and control number
(001) for linking of bibliographic records.

Values:

-  Don't use

   -  When clicking on links to titles that appear next to 'Continues'
      and 'Continued by' in the detail display Koha will perform a title
      search

-  Use

   -  When clicking on links to titles that appear next to 'Continues'
      and 'Continued by' in the detail display Koha will perform a
      control number (MARC field 001) search

    **Important**

    Unless you are going in and manually changing 773$w to match your
    rigorously-defined bibliographic relationships, you should set this
    preference to "Don't use" and instead set
    `EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ to "Display"

Description:

-  If you have a serial called "Journal of Interesting Things" which has
   a separate record from when it was called "Transactions of the
   Interesting Stuff Society," you could add linking fields to indicate
   the relationship between the two records. UseControlNumber allows you
   to use your local accession numbers for those links. In MARC21, the
   relevant sections of the two records might look like this:

   ::

           =001    12345
           =110  2_$aInteresting Stuff Society.
           =245  10$aTransactions of the Interesting Stuff Society.
           =785  00$aInteresting Stuff Society$tJournal of Interesting Things.$w12346
            
           =001    12346
           =110  2_$aInteresting Stuff Society.
           =245  10$aJournal of Interesting Things.
           =780  00$aInteresting Stuff Society$tTransactions of the Interesting Stuff Society.$w12345

   With UseControlNumber set to 'Use', the 78x links will use the
   Control Numbers is subfield $w, instead of doing a title search on
   "Journal of Interesting Things" and "Transactions of the Interesting
   Stuff Society" respectively.

`Exporting <#catexportprefs>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`BibtexExportAdditionalFields <#BibtexExportAdditionalFields>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Include following fields when exporting BibTeX

Description:

-  Use one line per tag in the format BT\_TAG: TAG$SUBFIELD ( e.g. lccn:
   010$a )

-  To specificy multiple marc tags/subfields as targets for a repeating
   BibTex tag, use the following format: BT\_TAG: [TAG2$SUBFIELD1,
   TAG2$SUBFIELD2] ( e.g. notes: [501$a, 505$g] )

-  All values of repeating tags and subfields will be printed with the
   given BibTeX tag.

-  Use '@' ( with quotes ) as the BT\_TAG to replace the bibtex record
   type with a field value of your choosing.

`RisExportAdditionalFields <#RisExportAdditionalFields>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Include following fields when exporting RIS

Description:

-  Use one line per tag in the format RIS\_TAG: TAG$SUBFIELD ( e.g. LC:
   010$a )

-  To specificy multiple marc tags/subfields as targets for a repeating
   RIS tag, use the following format: RIS\_TAG: [TAG2$SUBFIELD1,
   TAG2$SUBFIELD2] ( e.g. NT: [501$a, 505$g] )

-  All values of repeating tags and subfields will be printed with the
   given RIS tag.

-  Use of TY ( record type ) as a key will *replace* the default TY with
   the field value of your choosing.

`Importing <#catimportprefs>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`AggressiveMatchOnISBN <#AggressiveMatchOnISBN>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: don't

Asks: When matching on ISBN with the record import tool, \_\_\_ attempt
to match aggressively by trying all variations of the ISBNs in the
imported record as a phrase in the ISBN fields of already cataloged
records.

Values:

-  do

-  don't

Description:

-  This preference allows you to choose to alter the ISBN matching rule
   used when staging records for import to be more aggressive. This
   means that all text will be stripped from the ISBN field so that a
   pure number match is possible. If this preference is set to "Don't"
   then Koha will find a match only if the ISBN fields are identical.

    **Important**

    Note that this preference has no effect if
    `UseQueryParser <#UseQueryParser>`__ is on.

`Interface <#catinterfaceprefs>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`advancedMARCeditor <#advancedMARCeditor>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't display

Asks: \_\_\_ descriptions of fields and subfields in the MARC editor.

Description:

-  This preference determines whether or not MARC field names will be
   present when editing or creating MARC records.

Values:

-  Display

   MARC editor with text labels
   |image20|

-  Don't display

   MARC editor without text labels
   |image21|

`DefaultClassificationSource <#DefaultClassificationSource>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Dewey Decimal System

Asks: Use \_\_\_ as the default classification source.

Values:

-  ANSCR (Sound Recordings)

-  Dewey Decimal Classification

-  Library of Congress Classification

-  Other/Generic Classification Scheme

-  SuDoc Classification (U.S. GPO)

-  Universal Decimal Classification

`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't Display

Asks: \_\_\_ easy ways to create analytical record relationships

Values:

-  Display

-  Don't Display

    **Important**

    If you decide to use this feature you'll want to make sure that your
    `UseControlNumber <#UseControlNumber>`__ preference is set to "Don't
    use" or else the "Show analytics" links in the staff client and the
    OPAC will be broken.

Description:

-  An analytic entry in a catalog is one that describes a part of a
   larger work that is also described in the catalog. In bibliographic
   cataloging, analytic entries may be made for chapters in books or
   special issues of articles in periodicals. In archival cataloging,
   analytic entries may be made for series or items within a collection.
   This feature in Koha allows for an easy way of linking analytic
   entries to the host records, and this system preference adds several
   new menu options to the staff cataloging detail pages to allow that
   to happen.

`Record Structure <#catrecordprefs>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`AlternateHoldingsField & AlternateHoldingsSeparator <#AlternateHoldingsField>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Display MARC subfield \_\_\_ as holdings information for records
that do not have items, with the subfields separated by \_\_\_.

Description:

-  Sometimes libraries migrate to Koha with their holding info in the
   852 field (OCLC holdings information field) and choose not to
   transfer that information into the 952 (Koha holdings information
   field) because they don't plan on circulating those items. For those
   libraries or other libraries that have data in the 852 fields of
   their records that they want to display, these preferences let you
   choose to display holdings info from a field other than the 952
   field. The AlternateHoldingsField preference can contain multiple
   subfields to look in; for instance 852abhi would look in 852
   subfields a, b, h, and i.

-  With AlternateHoldingsField set to 852abhi and
   AlternateHoldingsSeparator set to a space the holdings would look
   like the following:

   Alternate Holdings Display

`autoBarcode <#autoBarcode>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: generated in the form <branchcode>yymm0001

Asks: Barcodes are \_\_\_

Values:

-  generated in the form <branchcode>yymm0001

-  generated in the form <year>-0001, <year>-0002

-  generated in the form 1, 2, 3

-  incremental EAN-13 barcodes

-  not generated automatically

Description:

-  This setting is for libraries wishing to generate barcodes from
   within Koha (as opposed to scanning in pre-printed barcodes or
   manually assigning them). The default behavior makes it so that when
   you click in the barcode field (952$p in MARC21) it will populate
   with the automatic barcode you have chosen. If you would rather it
   only enter an automatic barcode when you click on the plugin (the ...
   to the right of the field) you can change the plugin used for that
   field in the framework. Set the plugin for 952$p (if using MARC21 or
   equivalent field mapped to items.barcode in your local MARC format)
   for your frameworks to barcode\_manual.pl instead of barcode.pl.

Default: specific item

Asks: Use the item type of the \_\_\_ as the authoritative item type
(for determining circulation and fines rules, etc).

Values:

-  biblio record

-  specific item

Description:

-  This preference determines whether the item type Koha uses for
   issuing rules will be an attribute of the bibliographic record or the
   item record. Most libraries refer to the item record for item types.
   It also determines if the item type icon appears on the OPAC search
   results. If you have the preference set to 'biblio record' then Koha
   displays the item type icon on the search results to the left of the
   result info.

Default: 082ab

Asks: Map the MARC subfield to an item's callnumber.

    **Note**

    This can contain multiple subfields to look in; for instance 082ab
    would look in 082 subfields a and b.

Description:

-  This setting determines which MARC field will be used to determine
   the call number that will be entered into item records automatically
   (952$o). The value is set by providing the MARC field code (050, 082,
   090, 852 are all common in MARC21) and the subfield codes without the
   delimiters ($a, $b would be ab).

Examples:

-  Dewey: 082ab or 092ab; LOC: 050ab or 090ab; from the item record:
   852hi

Asks: When a new item is added \_\_\_

Values:

-  the new item is not prefilled with last created item values.

-  the new item is prefilled with last created item values.

Description:

-  This preference controls the behavior used when adding new items.
   Using the options here you can choose to have your next new item
   prefill with the values used in the last item was added to save time
   typing values or to have the item form appear completely blank. Using
   `SubfieldsToUseWhenPrefill <#SubfieldsToUseWhenPrefill>`__ you can

`Checkin Policy <#checkinpolicyprefs>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`AllowMultipleIssuesOnABiblio <#AllowMultipleIssuesOnABiblio>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons to check out multiple items from the same record.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If this preference is set to 'Allow' then patrons will be able to
   check out multiple copies of the same title at the same time. If it's
   set to "Don't allow" then patrons will only be allowed to check out
   one item attached to a record at a time. Regardless of the option
   chosen in this preference records with subscriptions attached will
   allow multiple check outs.

       **Important**

       This will only effect records without a subscription attached.

`BlockReturnOfWithdrawnItems <#BlockReturnOfWithdrawnItems>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Block

Asks: \_\_\_ returning of items that have been withdrawn.

Values:

   (952$0 in MARC21) can be checked in or not.

`CalculateFinesOnReturn <#CalculateFinesOnReturn>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Do

Asks: \_\_\_ calculate and update overdue charges when an item is
returned.

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Description:

-  If this preference is set to "Do" and the `fines cron
   job <#finescronjob>`__ is off then Koha will calculate fines only
   when items are returned. If you have the fines cron job on and this
   preference set to "Do" then this preference will calculate fines
   based on the cron (usually run nightly) and then again when you check
   the item in. This option is best for those who are doing hourly
   loans. If this preference is set to "Don't" then fines will only be
   accrued if the fines cron job is running.

    **Important**

    If you are doing hourly loans then you should have this set to 'Do'.

`RentalFeesCheckoutConfirmation <#RentalFeesCheckoutConfirmation>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: do not ask

Asks: When checking out an item with rental fees, \_\_\_ for
confirmation.

Values:

-  askRentalFeesCheckoutConfirmation

-  do not ask

Description:

-  If you are charging rental fees for items this preference will make
   it so that you can show (or not show) a confirmation before checking
   out an item that will incur a rental charge.

`UpdateNotForLoanStatusOnCheckin <#UpdateNotForLoanStatusOnCheckin>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: This is a list of value pairs. When an item is checked in, if the
not for loan value on the left matches the items not for loan value it
will be updated to the right-hand value. E.g. '-1: 0' will cause an item
that was set to 'Ordered' to now be available for loan. Each pair of
values should be on a separate line.

`Checkout Policy <#circcheckoutpolicy>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`AgeRestrictionMarker <#AgeRestrictionMarker>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Restrict patrons with the following target audience values from
checking out inappropriate materials: \_\_\_

Description:

-  This preference defines certain keywords that will trigger Koha to
   restrict checkout based on age. These restrictions can be overridden
   by the `AgeRestrictionOverride <#AgeRestrictionOverride>`__
   preference. Enter in this field a series of keywords separated by bar
   (\|) with no spaces. For example PG\|R\|E\|EC\|Age\| will look for PG
   followed by an age number, R folllowed by an age number, Age followed
   by an age number, and so on. These values can appear in any MARC
   field, but Library of Congress recommends the 521$a (Target Audience
   Note). Whatever field you decide to use you must map the word
   agerestriction in the biblioitems table to that field in the `Koha to
   MARC Mapping <#kohamarcmapping>`__. When cataloging you can enter
   values like PG 13 or E 10 in the 521$a and Koha will then notify
   circulation librarians that the material may not be recommended for
   the patron based on their age.

       **Important**

       You must map the word agerestriction in the biblioitems table to
       the MARC field where this information will appear via the `Koha
       to MARC Mapping <#kohamarcmapping>`__ administration area.

`AgeRestrictionOverride <#AgeRestrictionOverride>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to check out an item with age restriction.

Values:

-  Allow

   Allow age restriction override
   |image25|

-  Don't allow

   Don't allow age restriction override
   |image26|

Description:

-  When the `AgeRestrictionMarker <#AgeRestrictionMarker>`__ preference
   is set, Koha will try to warn circulation librarians before checking
   out an item that might have an age restriction listed in the MARC
   record. This preference asks if you would like the staff to be able
   to still check out these items to patrons under the age limit.

`AllFinesNeedOverride <#AllFinesNeedOverride>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Require

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to manually override all fines, even fines less than
`noissuescharge <#noissuescharge>`__.

Values:

-  Don't require

-  Require

Description:

-  This preference let's you decide if you want to always be warned that
   the patron has fines when checking out. If you have it set to
   'Require' then no matter how much money the patron owes a message
   will pop up warning you that the patron owes money.

`AllowFineOverride <#AllowFineOverride>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to manually override and check out items to patrons
who have more than `noissuescharge <#noissuescharge>`__ in fines.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This preference lets you decide if you staff can check out to patrons
   who owe more money than you usually let them carry on their account.
   If set to 'Allow' staff will be warned that the patrons owes money,
   but it won't stop the staff from checking out to the patron.

`AllowItemsOnHoldCheckout <#AllowItemsOnHoldCheckout>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ checkouts of items reserved to someone else. If allowed do
not generate RESERVE\_WAITING and RESERVED warning. This allows self
checkouts for those items.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

    **Important**

    This system preference relates only to SIP based self checkout, not
    Koha's web based self checkout.

Description:

-  When this preference is set to 'Allow' patrons will be able to use
   your external self check machine to check out a book to themselves
   even if it's on hold for someone else. If you would like Koha to
   prevent people from checking out books that are on hold for someone
   else set this preference to "Don't allow."

`AllowNotForLoanOverride <#AllowNotForLoanOverride>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override and check out items that are marked as
not for loan.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which controls the ability of
   staff (patrons will always be prevented from checking these items
   out) to check out items that are marked as "not for loan". Setting it
   to "Allow" would allow such items to be checked out, setting it to
   "Don't allow" would prevent this. This setting determines whether
   items meant to stay in the library, such as reference materials, and
   other library resources can be checked out by patrons.

`AllowRenewalLimitOverride <#AllowRenewalLimitOverride>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to manually override the renewal limit and renew a
checkout when it would go over the renewal limit.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which controls the ability of
   staff to override the limits placed on the number of times an item
   can be renewed. Setting it to "Allow" would allow such limits to be
   overridden, setting it to "Don't allow" would prevent this. This is a
   preference in which if it is set to "allow" it would allow the
   library staff to use their judgment for overriding the renew limit
   for special cases, setting it to "Don't allow" prevents an
   opportunity for abuse by the library staff.

`AllowReturnToBranch <#AllowReturnToBranch>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: to any library

Asks: Allow materials to be returned to \_\_\_

Values:

-  either the library the item is from or the library it was checked out
   from.

-  only the library the item is from.

-  only the library the item was checked out from.

-  to any library.

Description:

-  This preference lets the library system decide how they will accept
   returns. Some systems allow for items to be returned to any library
   in the system (the default value of this preference) others want to
   limit item returns to only specific branches. This preference will
   allow you to limit item returns (checkins) to the branch(es) set in
   the value.

`AllowTooManyOverride <#AllowTooManyOverride>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override and check out items when the patron has
reached the maximum number of allowed checkouts.

Values:

-  Allow

   Allow too many checkouts override
   |image27|

-  Don't allow

   Don't allow too many checkouts override
   |image28|

Description:

-  If this preference is set to "Allow" then staff all will be presented
   with an option to checkout more items to a patron than are normally
   allowed in the `Circulation and Fine Rules <#circfinerules>`__. If
   this preference is set to "Don't allow" then no staff member will be
   able to check out more than the circulation limit.

`AutomaticItemReturn <#AutomaticItemReturn>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Do

Asks: \_\_\_ automatically transfer items to their home branch when they
are returned.

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether an item
   is returned to its home branch automatically or not. If set to
   "Don't", the staff member checking an item in at a location other
   than the item's home branch will be asked whether the item will
   remain at the non-home branch (in which case the new location will be
   marked as a holding location) or returned. Setting it to "Do" will
   ensure that items checked in at a branch other than their home branch
   will be sent to that home branch.

`AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions <#AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ allow OVERDUES restrictions triggered by sent notices to be
cleared automatically when all overdue items are returned by a patron.

Values:

-  Do

-  Do not

Description:

-  Using the `Overdue Notice/Status Triggers <#noticetriggers>`__ you
   can restrict patrons after they receive an overdue notice. This
   preference lets you define whether Koha will automatically remove
   that restriction once the overdue items in question are returned or
   not.

`CircControl <#CircControl>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: the library the item is from

Asks: Use the checkout and fines rules of \_\_\_

Values:

-  the library the item is from

   -  The `circulation and fines policies <#circfinerules>`__ will be
      determined by the item's library where
      `HomeOrHoldingBranch <#HomeOrHoldingBranch>`__ chooses if item's
      home library is used or holding library is used.

-  the library the patron is from

   -  The `circulation and fines policies <#circfinerules>`__ will be
      determined the patron's home library

-  the library you are logged in at

   -  The `circulation and fines policies <#circfinerules>`__ will be
      determined by the library that checked the item out to the patron

`ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts <#ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Consider

Asks: \_\_\_ on-site checkouts as normal checkouts. If enabled, the
number of checkouts allowed will be normal checkouts + on-site
checkouts. If disabled, both values will be checked separately.

Values:

-  Consider

-  Don't consider

Description:

-  This preference allows you to decide if checkouts that are
   `OnSiteCheckouts <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__ are counted toward the total
   checkouts a patron can have. You can also set your `circulation and
   fine rules <#circfinerules>`__ to allow only a certain number of
   normal and OnSite checkouts.

`DefaultLongOverdueChargeValue <#DefaultLongOverdueChargeValue>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Charge a lost item to the borrower's account when the LOST value
of the item changes to \_\_\_

Description:

-  Leave this field empty if you don't want to charge the user for lost
   items. If you want the user to be charged enter the `LOST authorized
   value <#lost>`__ you are using in the
   `DefaultLongOverdueLostValue <#DefaultLongOverdueLostValue>`__
   preference. This preference is used when the `longoverdue cron
   job <#longoverduecron>`__ is called without the --charge parameter.

`DefaultLongOverdueLostValue & DefaultLongOverdueDays <#DefaultLongOverdueLostValue>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: By default, set the LOST value of an item to \_\_\_ when the item
has been overdue for more than \_\_\_ days.

Description:

-  These preferences are used when the `longoverdue cron
   job <#longoverduecron>`__ is called without the --lost parameter. It
   allows users to set the values of the `longoverdue
   cron <#longoverduecron>`__ without having to edit the crontab.
   Setting the values to 1 and 30 for example will mark the item with
   the `LOST authorized value <#lost>`__ of 1 after the item is 30 days
   overdue.

`HoldsInNoissuesCharge <#HoldsInNoissuesCharge>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't include

Asks: \_\_\_ hold charges when summing up charges for noissuescharge.

Values:

-  Don't include

-  Include

`HomeOrHoldingBranch <#HomeOrHoldingBranch>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: the library the item was checked out from

Asks: Use the checkout and fines rules of \_\_\_

Values:

-  the library the item is from

   -  This is equivalent to 'home library'

-  the library the item was checked out from

   -  This is equivalent to 'holding library'

Description:

-  This preference does several things.

   -  If `CircControl <#CircControl>`__ is set to 'the library the item
      is from' then the `circulation and fines
      policies <#circfinerules>`__ will be determined by the item's
      library where HomeOrHoldingBranch chooses if item's home library
      is used or holding library is used.

   -  If `IndependentBranches <#IndependentBranches>`__ is set to
      'Prevent' then the value of this preference is used in figuring
      out if the item can be checked out. If the item's home library
      does not match the logged in library, the item cannot be checked
      out unless you are a `superlibrarian <#patronpermsdefined>`__.

    **Important**

    It is not recommend that this setting be changed after initial setup
    of Koha because it will change the behavior of items already checked
    out.

`InProcessingToShelvingCart <#InProcessingToShelvingCart>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't move

Asks: \_\_\_ items that have the location PROC to the location CART when
they are checked in.

Values:

-  Don't move

-  Move

Description:

-  This preference is used to manage automatically changing item
   locations from processing (PROC) to the book cart (CART). A `cron
   job <#proccartcron>`__ needs to be set to run at specified intervals
   to age items from CART to the permanent shelving location. (For
   example, an hourly cron entry of cart\_to\_shelf.pl --hours 3 where
   --hours is the amount of time an item should spend on the cart before
   aging to its permanent location.) More information can be found in
   the `related chapter <#processinglocations>`__ in this manual.

   -  **Note**

          If the `ReturnToShelvingCart <#ReturnToShelvingCart>`__ system
          preference is turned on, any newly checked-in item is also
          automatically put into the shelving cart, to be covered by the
          same script run.

   -  **Important**

          Checkins with confirmed holds will not go into the shelving
          cart. If items on the shelving cart are checked out, the cart
          location will be cleared.

`IssuingInProcess <#IssuingInProcess>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't prevent

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons from checking out an item whose rental charge would
take them over the limit.

Values:

-  Don't prevent

-  Prevent

Description:

-  This preference determines if a patron can check items out if there
   is an overdue fine on the account and any of the materials the patron
   wishes to check out will potentially tip the account balance over the
   maximum fines policy the library has in place.

Example: Your library has a $5 limit set for 'fines' (ie, after
incurring $5 in fines, a patron can no longer check out items). A patron
comes to the desk with 5 items to check out (4 books and a video) The
patron has $4 in charges already on their account. One of the videos has
a rental charge of $1, therefore making the total fines on the patron's
account suddenly $5 (the limit).

`IssueLostItem <#IssueLostItem>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: display a message

Asks: When issuing an item that has been marked as lost, \_\_\_.

Values:

-  display a message

   Lost message when checking out
   |image29|

-  do nothing

   -  This option will just check the item out without notifying you
      that the item was marked lost.

-  require confirmation

   Confirm checkout of lost item

Description:

-  This preference lets you define how library staff are notified that
   an item with a lost status is being checked out. This will help staff
   mark items as 'available' if you choose to 'display a message' or
   'require confirmation.' If you choose to 'do nothing,' there will be
   no notification that the item being checked out is marked as 'lost.'

noissuescharge.

Values:

-  Don't include

-  Include

Description:

-  This preference lets you decide if charges entered as manual invoices
   are included when calculating the
   `noissuescharge <#noissuescharge>`__. If this is set to include then
   Koha will include all manual invoices when deciding if the patron
   owes too much money to check anything else out of the library. If
   it's set to Don't include then Koha will ignore all manual invoice
   charges when figuring out if the patron owes too much money to
   checkout additional materials.

`maxoutstanding <#maxoutstanding>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: 5

Asks: Prevent patrons from making holds on the OPAC if they owe more
than \_\_\_ USD in fines.

Default: 5

Asks: Prevent patrons from checking out books if they have more than
\_\_\_ USD in fines.

Description:

-  This preference is the maximum amount of money owed to the library
   before the user is banned from borrowing more items. Using the
   `ManInvInNoissuesCharge <#ManInvInNoissuesCharge>`__ and
   `RentalsInNoissuesCharge <#RentalsInNoissuesCharge>`__ preferences
   you can control which types of charges are considered in this total.
   This also coincides with `maxoutstanding <#maxoutstanding>`__ that
   limits patrons from placing holds when the maximum amount is owed to
   the library.

`NoIssuesChargeGuarantees <#NoIssuesChargeGuarantees>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Disable

Asks: \_\_\_ the on-site for all cases (Even if a user is debarred,
etc.).

Values:

-  Disable

-  Enable

   Force checkouts on restricted patrons
   |image31|

Description:

-  This preference lets the staff override any restrictions a patron
   might have and check out items for use within the library. The
   `OnSiteCheckouts <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__ preference must first be set
   to 'Enable' for this preference to be considered.

This preference makes it so that a librarian can get a copy of every
notice sent out to patrons.

    **Note**

    If you'd like more than one person to receive the blind copy you can
    simply enter in multiple email addresses separated by commas.

    **Note**

    The name of this preference is misleading, it does not only send
    overdues, but all notices to the BCC address.

`OverdueNoticeCalendar <#OverdueNoticeCalendar>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Ignore calendar

Asks: \_\_\_ when working out the period for overdue notices

Values:

-  Ignore calendar

   -  Notices do not take holidays into account, so they will be sent
      even if holidays have meant the item is not actually overdue yet

-  Use calendar

   -  Notices take holidays into account, so they will not be sent if
      holidays mean the item is not actually overdue yet

`PrintNoticesMaxLines <#PrintNoticesMaxLines>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Include up to \_\_\_ item lines in a printed overdue notice.

    **Note**

    for a full list of overdue items.

    **Note**

    Set to 0 to include all overdue items in the notice, no matter how
    many there are.

    **Important**

preferences.

Values:

-  Don't send

-  Send

Description:

-  If a patron has chosen to receive a check out notice in their
   messaging preferences and this preference is set to 'Send' then those
   patrons will also receive a notice when they renew materials. You
   will want to set up a `new notice <#addnotices>`__ with the code of
   RENEWAL (if you don't already have it) with custom text for renewing
   items.

       **Important**

       This preference requires that you have
       `EnhancedMessagingPreferences <#EnhancedMessagingPreferences>`__
       set to 'Allow'

`RentalsInNoissuesCharge <#RentalsInNoissuesCharge>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Include

Asks: \_\_\_ rental charges when summing up charges for noissuescharge.

Values:

-  Don't include

-  Include

Description:

-  This preference lets you decide if rental charges are included when
   calculating the `noissuescharge <#noissuescharge>`__. If this is set
   to include then Koha will include all rental charges when deciding if
   the patron owes too much money to check anything else out of the
   library. If it's set to Don't include then Koha will ignore all
   rental charges when figuring out if the patron owes too much money to
   checkout additional materials.

`RestrictionBlockRenewing <#RestrictionBlockRenewing>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: If patron is restricted, \_\_\_ renewing of items.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Block

`ReturnBeforeExpiry <#ReturnBeforeExpiry>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't require

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons to return books before their accounts expire (by
restricting due dates to before the patron's expiration date).

Values:

-  Don't require

-  Require

Description:

-  This is preference may prevent a patron from having items checked out
   after their library card has expired. If this is set to "Require",
   then a due date of any checked out item can not be set for a date
   which falls after the patron's card expiration. If the setting is
   left "Don't require" then item check out dates may exceed the
   expiration date for the patron's library card.

`ReturnToShelvingCart <#ReturnToShelvingCart>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't move

Asks: \_\_\_ all items to the location CART when they are checked in.

Values:

-  Don't move

-  Move

Description:

-  More information can be found in the `related
   chapter <#processinglocations>`__ in this manual.

`StaffSearchResultsDisplayBranch <#StaffSearchResultsDisplayBranch>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: the library the item is held by

Asks: For search results in the staff client, display the branch of
\_\_\_

Values:

-  the library the item is from

-  the library the items is held by

`TransfersMaxDaysWarning <#TransfersMaxDaysWarning>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: 3

Asks: Show a warning on the "Transfers to Receive" screen if the
transfer has not been received \_\_\_ days after it is sent.

Description:

-  The TransferMaxDaysWarning preference is set at a default number of
   days. This preference allows for a warning to appear after a set
   amount of time if an item being transferred between library branches
   has not been received. The warning will appear in the `Transfers to
   Receive <#transferstoreceive>`__ report.

`UseBranchTransferLimits & BranchTransferLimitsType <#UseBranchTransferLimits>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Defaults: Don't enforce & collection code

Asks: \_\_\_ branch transfer limits based on \_\_\_

UseBranchTransferLimits Values:

-  Don't enforce

-  Enforce

BranchTransferLimitsType Values:

-  collection code

-  item type

BranchTransferLimitsType Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which determines whether items are
   transferred according to item type or collection code. This value
   determines how the library manager is able to restrict what items can
   be transferred between the branches.

`useDaysMode <#useDaysMode>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't include

Asks: Calculate the due date using \_\_\_.

Values:

-  circulation rules only.

-  the calendar to push the due date to the next open day.

-  the calendar to skip all days the library is closed.

Description:

-  This preference controls how scheduled library closures affect the
   due date of a material. The 'the calendar to skip all days the
   library is closed' setting allows for a scheduled closure not to
   count as a day in the loan period, the 'circulation rules only'
   setting would not consider the scheduled closure at all, and 'the
   calendar to push the due date to the next open day' would only effect
   the due date if the day the item is due would fall specifically on
   the day of closure.

Example:

-  The library has put December 24th and 25th in as closures on the
   calendar. A book checked out by a patron has a due date of December
   25th according to the circulation and fine rules. If this preference
   is set to 'circulation rules only' then the item will remain due on
   the 25th. If the preference is set to 'the calendar to push the due
   date to the next open day' then the due date will be December 26th.
   If the preference is set to 'the calendar to skip all days the
   library is closed' then the due date will be pushed to the 27th of
   December to accommodate for the two closed days.

The calendar is defined on a branch by branch basis. To learn more about
the calendar, check out the '`Calendar & Holidays <#calholidays>`__'
section of this manual.

`UseTransportCostMatrix <#UseTransportCostMatrix>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ Transport Cost Matrix for calculating optimal holds filling
between branches.

Values:

-  Don't use

-  Use

Description:

-  If the system is configured to use the `Transport cost
   matrix <#transportcostmatrix>`__ for filling holds, then when
   attempting to fill a hold, the system will search for the lowest cost
   branch, and attempt to fill the hold with an item from that branch
   first. Branches of equal cost will be selected from randomly. The
   branch or branches of the next highest cost shall be selected from
   only if all the branches in the previous group are unable to fill the
   hold.

   The system will use the item's current holding branch when
   determining whether the item can fulfill a hold using the Transport
   Cost Matrix.

`Course Reserves <#coursereserveprefs>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`UseCourseReserves <#UseCourseReserves>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ course reserves

Values:

-  Don't use

-  Use

Description:

-  The `Course Reserves <#coursereserves>`__ module in Koha allows you
   to temporarily move items to 'reserve' and assign different
   circulation rules to these items while they are being used for a
   specific course.

`Fines Policy <#circfinespolicy>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`finesCalendar <#finesCalendar>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: not including the days the library is closed

Asks: Calculate fines based on days overdue \_\_\_

Values:

-  directly

-  not including the days the library is closed

Description:

-  This preference will determine whether or not fines will be accrued
   during instances when the library is closed. Examples include
   holidays, library in-service days, etc. Choosing "not including the
   days the library is closed" setting will enable Koha to access its
   `Calendar <#calholidays>`__ module and be considerate of dates when
   the library is closed. To make use of this setting the administrator
   must first access Koha's calendar and mark certain days as "holidays"
   ahead of time.

The calendar is defined on a branch by branch basis. To learn more about
the calendar, check out the '`Calendar & Holidays <#calholidays>`__'
section of this manual.

`FinesIncludeGracePeriod <#FinesIncludeGracePeriod>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Include

Asks: \_\_\_ the grace period when calculating the fine for an overdue
item.

Values:

-  Don't include

-  Include

Description:

-  This preference lets you control how Koha calculates fines when there
   is a grace period. If you choose to include the grace period when
   calculating fines then Koha will charge for the days in the grace
   period should the item be overdue more than those days. If you choose
   not to include the grace period then Koha will only charge for the
   days overdue after the grace period.

`finesMode <#finesMode>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Calculate (but only for mailing to the admin)

Asks: \_\_\_ fines

Values:

-  Calculate (but only for mailing to the admin)

-  Calculate and charge

-  Don't calculate

    **Important**

    Requires that you have the fines cron job running
    (misc/cronjobs/fines.pl)

`RefundLostItemFeeOnReturn <#RefundLostItemFeeOnReturn>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Refund

Asks: \_\_\_ lost item fees charged to a borrower when the lost item is
returned.

Values:

-  Don't refund

-  Refund

Description:

-  When an item is marked lost in Koha the system charges the patron the
   replacement fee for the item. This preference lets you control how
   Koha handles returns of these items. By default when an item that was
   previously marked lost is checked in Koha refunds the patron the
   replacement fee. Change this preference to "Don't refund" if you
   would like Koha to not refund the replacement fee.

`WhenLostChargeReplacementFee <#WhenLostChargeReplacementFee>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Charge

Asks: \_\_\_ the replacement price when a patron loses an item.

Values:

-  Charge

-  Don't charge

Description:

-  This preference lets you tell Koha what to do with an item is marked
   lost. If you want Koha can 'Charge' the patron the replacement fee
   listed on the item they lost or it can do nothing in reference to the
   patron and just mark the item lost in the catalog.

`WhenLostForgiveFine <#WhenLostForgiveFine>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't forgive

Asks: \_\_\_ the fines on an item when it is lost.

Values:

-  Don't forgive

-  Forgive

Description:

-  This preference allows the library to decide if fines are charged in
   addition to the replacement fee when an item is marked as lost. If
   this preference is set to 'Forgive' then the patron won't be charged
   fines in addition to the replacement fee.

`Holds Policy <#circholdspolicy>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`AllowHoldDateInFuture <#AllowHoldDateInFuture>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold requests to be placed that do not enter the waiting
list until a certain future date.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

`AllowHoldItemTypeSelection <#AllowHoldItemTypeSelection>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold fulfillment to be limited by itemtype.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

`AllowHoldsOnDamagedItems <#AllowHoldsOnDamagedItems>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ hold requests to be placed on damaged items.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which controls whether or not hold
   requests can be placed on items that are marked as "damaged" (items
   are marked as damaged by editing subfield 4 on the item record).
   Setting this value to "Don't allow" will prevent anyone from placing
   a hold on such items, setting it to "Allow" will allow it. This
   preference is important because it determines whether or not a patron
   can place a request for an item that might be in the process of being
   repaired or not in good condition. The library may wish to set this
   to "Don't allow" if they were concerned about their patrons not
   receiving the item in a timely manner or at all (if it is determined
   that the item is beyond repair). Setting it to "Allow" would allow a
   patron to place a hold on an item and therefore receive it as soon as
   it becomes available.

`AllowHoldsOnPatronsPossessions <#AllowHoldsOnPatronsPossessions>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_\_ a patron to place a hold on a record where the patron
already has one or more items attached to that record checked out.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  By setting to "Don't allow," you can prevent patrons from placing
   holds on items they already have out, thus preventing them from
   blocking anyone else from getting an item.

`AllowHoldPolicyOverride <#AllowHoldPolicyOverride>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override hold policies when placing holds.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which controls whether or not the
   library staff can override the circulation and fines rules as they
   pertain to the placement of holds. Setting this value to "Don't
   allow" will prevent anyone from overriding, setting it to "Allow"
   will allow it. This setting is important because it determines how
   strict the libraries rules for placing holds are. If this is set to
   "Allow", exceptions can be made for patrons who are otherwise
   normally in good standing with the library, but there is opportunity
   for the staff to abuse this function. If it is set to "Don't allow",
   no abuse of the system is possible, but it makes the system entirely
   inflexible in respect to holds.

`AllowRenewalIfOtherItemsAvailable <#AllowRenewalIfOtherItemsAvailable>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a patron to renew an item with unfilled holds if other
available items can fill that hold.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds <#AutoResumeSuspendedHolds>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ suspended holds to be automatically resumed by a set date.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If this preference is set to 'Allow' then all suspended holds will be
   able to have a date at after which they automatically become
   unsuspended. If you have this preference set to 'Allow' you will also
   need the `Unsuspend Holds <#unsuspendholdcron>`__ cron job running.

    **Important**

    The holds will become unsuspended the date after that entered by the
    patron.

`canreservefromotherbranches <#canreservefromotherbranches>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a user from one library to place a hold on an item from
another library

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether patrons
   can place holds on items from other branches. If the preference is
   set to "Allow" patrons can place such holds, if it is set to "Don't
   allow" they cannot. This is an important setting because it
   determines if users can use Koha to request items from another
   branch. If the library is sharing an installation of Koha with other
   independent libraries which do not wish to allow interlibrary
   borrowing it is recommended that this parameter be set to "Don't
   allow".

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow (with `independent branches <#IndependentBranches>`__)

`ConfirmFutureHolds <#ConfirmFutureHolds>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: 0

Asks: Confirm future hold requests (starting no later than \_\_\_ days
from now) at checkin time.

Description:

-  When confirming a hold at checkin time, the number of days in this
   preference is taken into account when deciding which holds to show
   alerts for. This preference does not interfere with renewing,
   checking out or transferring a book.

    **Note**

    This number of days will be used too in calculating the default end
    date for the Holds to pull-report. But it does not interfere with
    issuing, renewing or transferring books.

    **Important**

    This preference is only looked at if you're allowing hold dates in
    the future with `AllowHoldDateInFuture <#AllowHoldDateInFuture>`__
    or `OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture <#OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture>`__

`decreaseLoanHighHolds, decreaseLoanHighHoldsDuration, decreaseLoanHighHoldsValue, decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl, and decreaseLoanHighHoldsIgnoreStatuses <#decreaseLoanHighHolds>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: \_\_\_ the reduction of loan period \_\_\_ to days for items with
more than \_\_\_ holds \_\_\_ . Ignore items with the following statuses
when counting items \_\_\_

decreaseLoanHighHolds default: Don't enable

decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl default: on the record

decreaseLoanHighHolds values:

-  Enable

decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl values:

-  over the number of holdable items on the records

-  on the record

decreaseLoanHighHoldsIgnoreStatuses values:

-  [Select All]

-  Damages

-  Lost

-  Not for loan

-  Withdrawn

Description:

-  These preferences let you change the loan length for items that have
   many holds on them. This will not effect items that are already
   checked out, but items that are checked out after the
   decreaseLoanHighHoldsValue is met will only be checked out for the
   number of days entered in the decreaseLoanHighHoldsDuration
   preference.

`DisplayMultiPlaceHold <#DisplayMultiPlaceHold>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ the ability to place holds on multiple biblio from the
search results

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

`emailLibrarianWhenHoldIsPlaced <#emailLibrarianWhenHoldIsPlaced>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ sending an email to the Koha administrator email address
whenever a hold request is placed.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  This preference enables Koha to email the library staff whenever a
   patron requests an item to be held. While this function will
   immediately alert the librarian to the patron's need, it is extremely
   impractical in most library settings. In most libraries the hold
   lists are monitored and maintained from a separate interface. That
   said, many libraries that allow on shelf holds prefer to have this
   preference turned on so that they are alerted to pull an item from
   the shelf.

    **Important**

    In order for this email to send you must have a
    `notice <#notices>`__ template with the code of HOLDPLACED

    **Important**

    This notice will only be sent if the `process\_message\_queue.pl
    cronjob <#msgqueuecron>`__ being run periodically to send the
    messages.

`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay <#ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to expire automatically if they have not been picked
by within the time period specified in
`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay <#ReservesMaxPickUpDelay>`__

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If set to 'allow' this will cancel holds that have been waiting for
   longer than the number of days specified in the
   `ReservesMaxPickUpDelay <#ReservesMaxPickUpDelay>`__ system
   preference. Holds will only be cancelled if the `Expire Holds cron
   job <#expiredholdscron>`__ is runnning.

`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelayCharge <#ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelayCharge>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: 0

Asks: If using
`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay <#ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay>`__, charge
a borrower who allows his or her waiting hold to expire a fee of \_\_\_
USD

Description:

-  If you are expiring holds that have been waiting too long you can use
   this preference to charge the patron for not picking up their hold.
   If you don't charge patrons for items that aren't picked up you can
   leave this set to the default which is 0. Holds will only be
   cancelled and charged if the `Expire Holds cron
   job <#expiredholdscron>`__ is running.

`ExpireReservesOnHolidays <#ExpireReservesOnHolidays>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ expired holds to be cancelled on days the library is
closed.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This feature will allow libraries to specify that, when an item is
   returned, a local hold may be given priority for fulfillment even
   though it is of lower priority in the list of unfilled holds.

`maxreserves <#maxreserves>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: 50

Asks: Patrons can only have \_\_\_ holds at once.

`OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture <#OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons to place holds that don't enter the waiting list
until a certain future date.

Values:

-  Allow

   -  `AllowHoldDateInFuture <#AllowHoldDateInFuture>`__ must also be
      enabled for this to work

-  Don't allow

`OPACAllowUserToChooseBranch <#OPACAllowUserToChooseBranch>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a user to choose the branch to pick up a hold from.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  Changing this preference will not prevent staff from being able to
   transfer titles from one branch to another to fill a hold, it will
   only prevent patrons from saying they plan on picking a book up at a
   branch other than their home branch.

`ReservesControlBranch <#ReservesControlBranch>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: item's home library

Asks: Check the \_\_\_ to see if the patron can place a hold on the
item.

Values:

-  item's home library.

-  patron's home library.

`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay <#ReservesMaxPickUpDelay>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: 7

Asks: Mark a hold as problematic if it has been waiting for more than
\_\_\_ days.

Description:

-  This preference (based on calendar days, not the `Koha holiday
   calendar <#calholidays>`__) puts an expiration date on an item a
   patron has on hold. After this expiration date the staff will have
   the option to release the unclaimed hold which then may be returned
   to the library shelf or issued to the next patron on the item's hold
   list. Items that are 'expired' by this preference are moved to the
   'Holds Over' tab on the '`Holds Awaiting Pickup <#holdspickup>`__'
   report.

`ReservesNeedReturns <#ReservesNeedReturns>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't automatically

Asks: \_\_\_ mark holds as found and waiting when a hold is placed
specifically on them and they are already checked in.

Values:

-  Automatically

-  Don't automatically

Description:

-  This preference refers to 'item specific' holds where the item is
   currently on the library shelf. This preference allows a library to
   decide whether an 'item specific' hold is marked as "Waiting" at the
   time the hold is placed or if the item will be marked as "Waiting"
   after the item is checked in. This preference will tell the patron
   that their item is 'Waiting' for them at their library and ready for
   check out.

`StaticHoldsQueueWeight, HoldsQueueSkipClosed & RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

StaticHoldsQueueWeight Default: 0

HoldsQueueSkipClosed Default: open or closed

RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight Default: in that order

Asks: Satisfy holds using items from the libraries \_\_\_ (as
branchcodes, separated by commas; if empty, uses all libraries) when
they are \_\_\_ \_\_\_.

HoldsQueueSkipClosed Values:

-  open or closed

-  open

RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight Values:

-  in random order

   -  If StaticHoldsQueueWeight is left at the default Koha will
      randomize all libraries, otherwise it will randomize the libraries
      listed.

-  in that order

   -  If StaticHoldsQueueWeight is left at the default then this will
      use all of your branches in alphabetical order, otherwise it will
      use the branches in the order that you entered them in the
      StaticHoldsQueueWeight preference.

Descriptions:

-  These preferences control how the `Holds Queue
   report <#holdsqueue>`__ is generated using `a cron
   job <#buildholdscron>`__.

   If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the
   on-shelf holds fulfillment process, you should list the the libraries
   that \*do\* participate in the process here by inputting all the
   participating library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g.
   "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc. ).

   By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system
   will first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the
   pickup library if possible. If there are no items available at the
   pickup library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use
   the list of libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled ( which it is by default ), the
   script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
   placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

   For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
   small, medium and large ) and you want the burden of holds
   fulfillment to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you
   would want StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like
   "LRG,MED,SML".

   If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
   throughout your library system, simply enable
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight. When this system preference is enabled,
   the order in which libraries will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf
   hold will be randomized each time the list is regenerated.

   Leaving StaticHoldsQueueWeight empty is contraindicated at this time.
   Doing so will cause the build\_holds\_queue script to ignore
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight, causing the script to request hold
   fulfillment not randomly, but by alphabetical order.

    **Important**

    The `Transport Cost Matrix <#transportcostmatrix>`__ takes
    precedence in controlling where holds are filled from, if the matrix
    is not used then Koha checks the StaticHoldsQueueWeight. To use the
    Transport Cost Matrix simply set your
    `UseTransportCostMatrix <#UseTransportCostMatrix>`__ preference to
    'Use'

`SuspendHoldsIntranet <#SuspendHoldsIntranet>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to be suspended from the intranet.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  The holds suspension feature can be turned on and off in the staff
   client by altering this system preference. If this is set to 'allow'
   you will want to set the
   `AutoResumeSuspendedHolds <#AutoResumeSuspendedHolds>`__ system
   preference.

`SuspendHoldsOpac <#SuspendHoldsOpac>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to be suspended from the OPAC.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  The holds suspension feature can be turned on and off in the OPAC by
   altering this system preference. If this is set to 'allow' you will
   want to set the
   `AutoResumeSuspendedHolds <#AutoResumeSuspendedHolds>`__ system
   preference.

`TransferWhenCancelAllWaitingHolds <#TransferWhenCancelAllWaitingHolds>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't transfer

Asks: \_\_\_ items when cancelling all waiting holds.

Values:

-  Don't transfer

-  Transfer

Description:

-  When TransferWhenCancelAllWaitingHolds is set to "Don't transfer", no
   branch transfer records are created. Koha will not allow the holds to
   be transferred, because that would orphan the items at the library
   where the holds were awaiting pickup, without any further instruction
   to staff as to what items are at the library or where they need to
   go. When that system preference set to "Transfer", branch transfers
   are created, so the holds may be cancelled.

`Interface <#circinterfaceprefs>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`AllowAllMessageDeletion <#AllowAllMessageDeletion>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to delete messages added from other libraries.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

`AllowOfflineCirculation <#AllowOfflineCirculation>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Do not enable

Asks: \_\_\_ offline circulation on regular circulation computers.

Values:

-  Do not enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  Setting this preference to 'Enable' allows you to use the Koha
   interface for `offline circulation <#offlinecirc>`__. This system
   preference does not affect the `Firefox
   plugin <#firefoxofflinecirc>`__ or the `desktop
   application <#windowsofflinecirc>`__, any of these three options can
   be used for offline circulation without effecting the other.

`AudioAlerts <#AudioAlerts>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ audio alerts for events defined in the audio alerts section
of administration.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

    **Important**

    This feature is not supported by all browsers. Requires an HTML5
    compliant browser.

`CircAutocompl <#CircAutocompl>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Try

Asks: \_\_\_ to automatically fill in the member when entering a patron
search on the circulation screen.

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether
   auto-completion of fields is enabled or disabled for the circulation
   input field. Setting it to "Try" would enable a staff member to begin
   typing a name or other value into the field and have a menu pop up
   with suggestions for completing it. Setting it to "Don't try" would
   disable this feature. This preference can make staff members' jobs
   easier or it could potentially slow down the page loading process.

Values:

-  Don't try

-  Try

   When CircAutocompl is turned on search results will appear below the
   search box
   |image33|

`CircAutoPrintQuickSlip <#CircAutoPrintQuickSlip>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: open a print quick slip window

Asks: When an empty barcode field is submitted in circulation \_\_\_

Values:

-  clear the screen

-  open a print quick slip window

-  open a print slip window

Description:

-  If this preference is set to open a quick slip
   (`ISSUEQSLIP <#existingnotices>`__) or open a slip
   (`ISSUESLIP <#existingnotices>`__) for printing it will eliminate the
   need for the librarian to click the print button to generate a
   checkout receipt for the patron they're checking out to. If the
   preference is set to clear the screen then "checking out" an empty
   barcode will clear the screen of the patron you were last working
   with.

`FilterBeforeOverdueReport <#FilterBeforeOverdueReport>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't require

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to choose which checkouts to show before running the
overdues report.

Description:

-  Koha's overdue report shows you all of the overdue items in your
   library system. If you have a large library system you'll want to set
   this preference to 'Require' to force those running the report to
   first limit the data generated to a branch, date range, patron
   category or other such filter. Requiring that the report be filtered
   before it's run prevents your staff from running a system heavy
   report and slowing down other operations in the system.

   Overdue Report Filters
   |image34|

Values:

-  Don't require

-  Require

`FineNotifyAtCheckin <#FineNotifyAtCheckin>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't notify

Asks: \_\_\_ librarians of overdue fines on the items they are checking
in.

Values:

-  Don't notify

-  Notify

Description:

-  With this preference set to 'Notify' all books that have overdue
   fines owed on them will pop up a warning when checking them in. This
   warning will need to acknowledged before you can continue checking
   items in. With this preference set to 'Don't notify,' you will still
   see fines owed on the patron record, you just won't have an
   additional notification at check in.

   Fine notification at checkin

`DisplayClearScreenButton <#DisplayClearScreenButton>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Show

Asks: \_\_\_ a button to clear the current patron from the screen on the
circulation screen.

Values:

-  Don't show

   No X in the top right
   |image36|

-  Show

   X in the top right will clear the screen
   |image37|

`ExportRemoveFields <#ExportRemoveFields>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: The following fields should be excluded from the patron checkout
history CSV or iso2709 export \_\_\_

Description:

-  This space separated list of fields (e.g. 100a 245b) will
   automatically be excluded when exporting the patron's current
   checkout history.

   ExportRemoveFields
   |image38|

`ExportWithCsvProfile <#ExportWithCsvProfile>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Use the \_\_\_ CSV profile when exporting patron checkout history

Description:

-  Use this preference to define which `CSV profile <#csvprofiles>`__
   should be used when exporting patron's current checkout data. Enter
   the CSV Profile name as the value for this preference. If this
   preference is left blank you will not be able to export the patron's
   current checkout summary.

   ExportWithCsvProfile

`HoldsToPullStartDate <#HoldsToPullStartDate>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: 2

Asks: Set the default start date for the Holds to pull list to \_\_\_
day(s) ago.

Description:

-  The `Holds to Pull <#holdspull>`__ report in circulation defaults to
   filtering holds placed 2 days ago. This preference allows you to set
   this default filter to any number of days.

`itemBarcodeFallbackSearch <#itemBarcodeFallbackSearch>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ the automatic use of a keyword catalog search if the phrase
entered as a barcode on the checkout page does not turn up any results
during an item barcode search.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

   Checkout by keyword
   |image40|

Description:

-  Sometimes libraries want to checkout using something other than the
   barcode. Enabling this preference will do a keyword search of Koha to
   find the item you're trying to check out. You can use the call
   number, barcode, part of the title or anything you'd enter in the
   keyword search when this preference is enabled and Koha will ask you
   which item you're trying to check out.

    **Important**

    While you're not searching by barcode a barcode is required on every
    title you check out. Only titles with barcodes will appear in the
    search results.

   you to choose how you'd like the log of checked in items displays.

`SpecifyDueDate <#SpecifyDueDate>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to specify a due date for a checkout.

Due dates are calculated using your circulation and fines rules, but
staff can override that if you allow them to specify a due date at
checkout.

Description:

-  This preference allows for circulation staff to change a due date
   from the automatic due date to another calendar date. This option
   would be used for circumstances in which the due date may need to be
   decreased or extended in a specific circumstance. The "Allow" setting
   would allow for this option to be utilized by staff, the "Don't
   allow" setting would bar staff from changing the due date on
   materials.

Values:

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ update a bibliographic record's total issues count whenever
an item is issued

Values:

-  Do

       **Important**

       This increases server load significantly; if performance is a
       concern, use the `cron job <#updateissuescron>`__ to update the
       total issues count instead.

-  Do not

Description:

-  Koha can track the number of times and item is checked out and store
   that on the item record in the database. This information is not
   stored by default. Setting this preference to 'Do' will tell Koha to
   track that info everytime the item is checked out in real time.
   Otherwise you could use the `cron job <#updateissuescron>`__ to have
   Koha update that field nightly.

`WaitingNotifyAtCheckin <#WaitingNotifyAtCheckin>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't notify

   Koha's self check interface is simply for checking items out.

`AutoSelfCheckAllowed, AutoSelfCheckID & AutoSelfCheckPass <#AutoSelfCheckAllowed>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

    **Important**

    Most libraries will want to leave this set to 'Don't allow.' This
    preference turns off the requirement to log into the self checkout
    machine with a staff username and password by storing the username
    and password for automatic login.

AutoSelfCheckAllowed Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ the web-based self checkout system to automatically login
with this staff login \_\_\_ and this password \_\_\_ .

   instead of www.mycatalog.com). Once it is filled in Koha will use it
   to generate permanent links in your RSS feeds, for your social
   network share buttons and in your staff client when generating links
   to bib records in the OPAC.

    **Important**

    Do not include a trailing slash in the URL this will break links
    created using this URL. (example: http://www.google.com not
    http://www.google.com/)

    **Important**

    This must be filled in with the URL of your public catalog for RSS,
    unAPI, and search plugins to work.

    **Important**

    'OPAC View' links from bib records in the staff client:

`OpacAdditionalStylesheet <#OpacAdditionalStylesheet>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Asks: Include the additional CSS stylesheet \_\_\_ to override specified
settings from the default stylesheet.

Description:

-  The preference can look for stylesheets in the template directory for
   your OPAC language, for instance: /koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/prog/en/css.
   If you upload a custom file, opac-mystyles.css to this directory, you
   can specify it by entering opac-mystyles.css in your
   opaccolorstylesheet system preference. This adds your custom
   stylesheet as a linked stylesheet alongside the OPAC's default CSS
   files. This method is preferable because linked stylesheets are
   cached by the user's browser, meaning upon repeat visits to your site
   the user's browser will not have to re-download the stylesheet,
   instead using the copy in the browser's cache.

-  If you would rather, you can upload your CSS to another server and
   enter the full URL pointing to it's location remember to begin the
   URL with http://

    **Note**

    Leave this field blank to disable it

    **Note**

    This file will add a linked CSS, not replace the existing default

    **Important**

    Patrons registering via the OPAC will not need to be approved by a
    librarian. For this reason it is recommended that you set up a
    provisional `patron category <#patcats>`__ with no `circulation
    rights <#circfinerules>`__. That way patrons will have to come in to
    the library to verify their identity before given circulation rights

    out and place holds.

    **Important**

    If you leave this blank or enter in an invalid code your patrons
    will still be able to register but will not be given a username.

Description:

-  This preference determines if the patron's barcode is automatically

    **Important**

    You will need to reindex your bibliographic database when changing
    this preference.

`OpacGroupResults <#OpacGroupResults>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ PazPar2 to group similar results on the OPAC.

Values:

-  Don't use

-  Use

    **Important**

    This requires that `PazPar2 <http://www.indexdata.com/pazpar2>`__ is
    set up and running.

`QueryAutoTruncate <#QueryAutoTruncate>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: automatically

Asks: Perform wildcard searching (where, for example, Har would match
Harry and harp) \_\_\_ (The \* character would be used like so: Har\* or
\*logging.)

Values:

-  automatically

-  only if \* is added

Description:

-  This setting allows for searches to be automatically truncated or for
   additional characters to be added to the end of a search string. When
   set to "automatically" the search string automatically ends with a
   wildcard function. For example, a search for the word "invent" with
   auto truncation enabled will also retrieve results for inventor,
   invention, inventory, etc. If you don't want this to happen
   automatically you can still be perform wildcard searches manually by
   adding an asterisk (\*). Typing "invent\*" even with auto truncation
   disabled will retrieve the same inventor, invention, inventory
   results. Auto truncation bypasses the necessity to type long search
   strings in their entirety.

`QueryFuzzy <#QueryFuzzy>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Try

Asks: \_\_\_ to match similarly spelled words in a search (for example,
a search for flang would also match flange and fang)

   returns results that are similar to, but not exactly matching, the
   word or words entered by the user. This preference enables the search
   function to compensate for slightly misspelled names or phrases.

    **Important**

    Requires that `UseICU <#UseICU>`__ set to 'Not using'

`QueryStemming <#QueryStemming>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Try

Asks: \_\_\_ to match words of the same base in a search

Values:

-  Don't try

-  Try

   -  A search for enabling would also match enable and enabled

Description:

-  This preference enables word stemming. Stemming allows the search
   function to return multiple versions of the same word, as well as
   related terms (i.e., both fish and fishing would be returned).

`QueryWeightFields <#QueryWeightFields>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Default: Enable

Asks: \_\_\_ ranking of search results by relevance

-  Force

   -  Searches for complete subject fields (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=su,complete-subfield:World%20Wide%20Web)

Description:

-  When TraceCompleteSubfields is set to "force," clicking on links in
   non-authority controlled subject tracings will only find other
   records where the entire subfields match. Leaving it at "don't force"
   does a keyword search of the subject indexes.

    **Important**

    This preference assumes that you're using XSLT stylesheets as set in
    the `OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay <#OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay>`__ preference.

`TraceSubjectSubdivisions <#TraceSubjectSubdivisions>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   -  Searches for subject keywords (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=su,complete-subfield:%22Web%20sites%22)

-  Include

   -  Searches for complete subject fields (example:
      opac-search.pl?q=(su,complete-subfield:%22Web%20sites%22)%20and%20(su,complete-subfield:%22Design.%22))

Description:

-  When TraceSubjectSubdivisions is set to "Include," if you click on a
   subject with subdivisions (subfields other than 'a') they will be
   searched along with the subject heading (subfield 'a'). To have only
   the subject heading (subfield 'a') searched, set this preference to
   "Don't include."

Description:

-  ICU is a set of code libraries providing Unicode and Globalization
   support for software applications. What this means is ICU Zebra
   indexing is only necessary if you use non-roman characters in your
   cataloging. If using ICU Zebra indexing you will want to not use
   `QueryFuzzy <#QueryFuzzy>`__.

    **Important**

    This setting will not affect Zebra indexing, it should only be used
    to tell Koha that you have activated ICU indexing if you have
    actually done so, since there is no way for Koha to figure this out
    on its own.

    **Important**

    Talk to your system administrator when changing this preference to
    make sure that your system is set up properly for this to work.

`UseQueryParser <#UseQueryParser>`__

Description:

-  Once enabled you can visit http://YOURKOHACATALOG/cgi-bin/koha/oai.pl
   to see your file. For the Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for
   Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) there are two groups of 'participants':
   Data Providers and Service Providers. Data Providers (open archives,
   repositories) provide free access to metadata, and may, but do not
   necessarily, offer free access to full texts or other resources.
   OAI-PMH provides an easy to implement, low barrier solution for Data
   Providers. Service Providers use the OAI interfaces of the Data
   Providers to harvest and store metadata. Note that this means that
   there are no live search requests to the Data Providers; rather,
   services are based on the harvested data via OAI-PMH. Koha at present
   can only act as a Data Provider. It can not harvest from other
   repositories. The biggest stumbling block to having Koha harvest from
   other repositories is that MARC is the only metadata format that Koha
   indexes natively. Visit
   http://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/english/page3.htm for diagrams of how
   OAI-PMH works.

      is blue

      Checkin Message
      |image137|

      and an Alert is yellow.

      Checkin Alert
      |image138|

`Patrons & Circulation <#patscirc>`__
-------------------------------------

Settings for controlling circulation and patron information.

`Patron Categories <#patcats>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron categories allow you to organize your patrons into different
roles, age groups, and patron types.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons & Circulation > Patron
   Categories

Patron category list
|image148|

Patrons are assigned to one of six main categories:

-  Adult

   -  Most common patron type, usually used for a general 'Patron'
      category.

-  Child

   -  Children patrons can have a guardian to be attached to them.

-  Staff

   -  Librarians (and library workers) should be assigned the staff
      category so that you can `set their
      permissions <#patronpermissions>`__ and give them access to the
      staff client.

-  Organizational

   -  Organizational patrons are organizations. Organizations can be
      used as guarantors for Professional patrons.

-  Professional

   -  Professional patrons can be linked to Organizational patrons

-  Statistical

   -  This patron type is used strictly for statistical purposes, such
      as in house use of items.

`Adding a patron category <#addingpatroncat>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new patron category click 'New Category' at the top of the page

New patron category form

-  The 'Category Code' is an identifier for your new code.

   -  **Important**

          The category code is limited to 10 characters (numbers and
          letters)

   -  **Important**

          This field is required in order to save your patron category.
          If left blank you will be presented with an error.

          |image151|

-  Enrollment period (in months) should be filled in if you have a
   limited enrollment period for your patrons (eg. Student cards expire
   after 9 months or until a specific date)

   -  **Important**

          You cannot enter both a month limit and a date until. Choose
          to enter either one or the other.

   -  **Important**

          This field is required in order to save your patron category.
          If left blank you will be presented with an error.

          Missing fields error
          |image152|

-  Some patron categories can have a minimum age (in years) requirement
   associated with them, enter this age in the 'Age required'

   -  **Important**

          This value will only be checked if
          `BorrowerMandatoryField <#BorrowerMandatoryField>`__ defines
          the dateofbirth as a required field on the patron record

-  Patron categories can also have a maximum age (in years) associated
   with them (such as children), enter this age in the 'Upperage limit'

   -  **Important**

          This value will only be checked if
          `BorrowerMandatoryField <#BorrowerMandatoryField>`__ defines
          the dateofbirth as a required field on the patron record

-  If you charge a membership fee for your patrons (such as those who
   live in another region) you can enter that in the 'Enrollment fee'
   field.

   -  **Important**

          Only enter numbers and decimals in this field

   -  **Note**

          Depending on your value for the
          `FeeOnChangePatronCategory <#FeeOnChangePatronCategory>`__
          preference this fee will be charged on patron renewal as well
          as when they are first enrolled.

-  If you want your patron to receive overdue notices, set the 'Overdue
   notice required' to 'Yes'

-  You can decide on a patron category basis if lost items are shown in
   the staff client by making a choice from the 'Lost items in staff
   client' pull down

   Choose a value for 'Hide Lost Items'
   |image153|

   -  **Important**

          Note that this is only applicable in the staff client, so
          changing this value on patron categories who do not have
          access to the staff client won't make any difference

-  If you charge patrons for placing holds on items, enter the fee
   amount in the 'Hold fee' field.

   -  **Important**

          Only enter numbers and decimals in this field

-  In the 'Category type' field choose one of the six main parent
   categories

   Six main patron categories
   |image154|

   -  **Important**

          This field is required in order to save your patron category.
          If left blank you will be presented with an error.

          Missing fields error
          |image155|

-  The Branch Limitations let you limit this patron category to only
   some branches in your library system. Select 'All branches' if you
   would like any library to be able to use this category.

-  You can decide if this patron category is blocked from performing
   actions in the OPAC if their card is expired using the next option.
   By default it will follow the rule set in the
   `BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions <#BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions>`__
   preferenceBlock expired patrons

-  Next you can choose the default privacy settings for this patron
   category. This setting can be edited by the patron via the OPAC if
   you allow it with the `OPACPrivacy <#OPACPrivacy>`__ system
   preference.Default privacy

-  Finally you can assign advanced messaging preferences by default to a
   patron category

   -  **Important**

          Requires that you have
          `EnhancedMessagingPreferences <#EnhancedMessagingPreferences>`__
          enabled

   -  These defaults will be applied to new patrons that are added to
      the system. They will not edit the preferences of the existing
      patrons. Also, these can be changed for individual patrons, this
      setting is just a default to make it easier to set up messages for
      an entire category.

      -  **Note**

             After setting the default for the patron category you can
             force those changes to all existing patrons by running the
             *borrowers-force-messaging-defaults* script found in the
             *misc/maintenance* folder. Ask your system administrator
             for assistance with this script.

`Circulation and Fine Rules <#circfinerules>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These rules define how your items are circulated, how/when fines are
calculated and how holds are handled.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons & Circulation >
   Circulation and fines rules

The rules are applied from most specific to less specific, using the
first found in this order:

-  same library, same patron type, same item type

-  same library, same patron type, all item type

-  same library, all patron types, same item type

-  same library, all patron types, all item types

-  default (all libraries), same patron type, same item type

-  default (all libraries), same patron type, all item types

-  default (all libraries), all patron types, same item type

-  default (all libraries), all patron types, all item types

The `CircControl <#CircControl>`__ and
`HomeOrHoldingBranch <#HomeOrHoldingBranch>`__ also come in to play when
figuring out which circulation rule to follow.

-  If CircControl is set to "the library you are logged in at" circ
   rules will be selected based on the library you are logged in at

-  If CircControl is set to "the library the patron is from" circ rules
   will be selected based on the patron's library

-  If CircControl is set to "the library the item is from" circ rules
   will be selected based on the item's library where
   HomeOrHoldingBranch chooses if item's home library is used or holding
   library is used.

-  If `IndependentBranches <#IndependentBranches>`__ is set to 'Prevent'
   then the value of HomeOrHoldingBranch is used in figuring out if the
   item can be checked out. If the item's home library does not match
   the logged in library, the item cannot be checked out unless you are
   a `superlibrarian <#patronpermsdefined>`__.

    **Note**

    If you are a single library system choose your branch name before
    creating rules (sometimes having only rules for the 'all libraries'
    option can cause issues with holds)

    **Important**

    At the very least you will need to set a default circulation rule.
    This rule should be set for all item types, all libraries and all
    patron categories. That will catch all instances that do not match a
    specific rule. When checking out if you do not have a rule for all
    libraries, all item types and all patron types then you may see
    patrons getting blocked from placing holds. You will also want a
    rule for your specific library set for all item types and all patron
    types to avoid this holds issue. Koha needs to know what rule to
    fall back on.

`Default Circulation Rules <#defaultcircrules>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the issuing rules matrix you can define rules that depend on
patron/item type combos. To set your rules, choose a library from the
pull down (or 'all libraries' if you want to apply these rules to all
branches):

Libraries to apply the rules to
|image156|

From the matrix you can choose any combination of patron categories and
item types to apply the rules to

Setting issuing rules for your libraries
|image157|

-  First choose which patron category you'd like the rule to be applied
   to. If you leave this to 'All' it will apply to all patron categories

-  Choose the 'Item type' you would like this rule to apply to. If you
   leave this to 'All' it will apply to all item types

-  Limit the number of items a patron can have checked out at the same
   time by entering a number in the 'Current checkouts allowed' field

-  If you're allowing `OnSiteCheckouts <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__ then you
   may also want to set a limit on the number of items patron's can have
   onsite.

   -  **Note**

          This setting also depends on the
          `ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts <#ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts>`__
          preference

-  Define the period of time an item can be checked out to a patron by
   entering the number of units (days or hours) in the 'Loan period'
   box.

-  Choose which unit of time, Days or Hours, that the loan period and
   fines will be calculated in in the 'Unit' column

-  You can also define a hard due date for a specific patron category
   and item type. A hard due date ignores your usual circulation rules
   and makes it so that all items of the type defined are due on, before
   or after the date you specify.

-  'Fine amount' should have the amount you would like to charge for
   overdue items

   -  **Important**

          Enter only numbers and decimal points (no currency symbols).

-  Enter the 'Fine charging interval' in the unit you set (ex. charge
   fines every 1 day, or every 2 hours)

-  'When to charge' is most handy in libraries that have a fine charging
   interval of more than 1 day.

   -  End of interval

      -  Given a grace period of 2 days and a fine interval of 7 days,
         the first fine will appear 7 days after the due date, it will
         always take one fine interval (7 days), before the first fine
         is charged

   -  Start of interval

      -  Given a grace period of 2 days and a fine interval of 7 days,
         the first fine will appear 2 days after the due date and the
         second fine 7 days after the due date.

-  The 'Fine grace period' is the period of time an item can be overdue
   before you start charging fines.

   -  **Important**

          This can only be set for the Day unit, not in Hours

-  The 'Overdue fines cap' is the maximum fine for this patron and item
   combination

   -  **Important**

          If this field is left blank then Koha will not put a limit on
          the fines this item will accrue. A maximum fine amount can be
          set using the `MaxFine <#MaxFine>`__ system preference.

-  If you would like to prevent overcharging patrons for a lost items,
   you can check the box under 'Cap fine at replacement price.' This
   will prevent the patron's fines from going above the replacement
   price on the item.

   -  **Note**

          If the 'Overdue fines cap' is also set, the fine will be the
          lesser of the two, if both apply to the given overdue
          checkout.

-  If your library 'fines' patrons by suspending their account you can
   enter the number of days their fine should be suspended in the
   'Suspension in days' field

   -  **Important**

          This can only be set for the Day unit, not in Hours

-  You can also define the maximum number of days a patron will be
   suspended in the 'Max suspension duration' setting

-  Next decide if the patron can renew this item type and if so, enter
   how many times they can renew it in the 'Renewals allowed' box

-  If you're allowing renewals you can control how long the renewal loan
   period will be (in the units you have chosen) in the 'Renewal period'
   box

-  If you're allowing renewals you can control how soon before the due
   date patrons can renew their materials with the 'No renewals before'
   box.

   -  Items can be renewed at any time if this value is left blank.
      Otherwise items can only be renewed if the item is due after the
      number in units (days/hours) entered in this box.

   -  To control this value on a more granular level please set the
      `NoRenewalBeforePrecision <#NoRenewalBeforePrecision>`__
      preference.

-  You can enable automatic renewals for certain items/patrons if you'd
   like. This will renew automatically following your circulation rules
   unless there is a hold on the item

   -  **Important**

          You will need to enable the `automatic renewal cron
          job <#autorenewcron>`__ for this to work.

   -  **Important**

          This feature needs to have the "no renewal before" column
          filled in or it will auto renew everyday after the due date

-  If the patron can place holds on this item type, enter the total
   numbers of items (of this type) that can be put on hold in the 'Holds
   allowed' field

-  Next you can decide if this patron/item combo are allowed to place
   holds on items that are on the shelf (or available in the library) or
   not. If you choose 'no' then items can only be placed on hold if
   checked out

-  You can also decide if patrons are allowed to place item specific
   holds on the item type in question. The options are:

   -  Allow: Will allow patrons the option to choose next available or
      item specific

   -  Don't allow: Will only allow patrons to choose next available

   -  Force: Will only allow patrons to choose an specific item

-  Finally, if you charge a `rental fee <#rentalcharge>`__ for the item
   type and want to give a specific patron type a discount on that fee,
   enter the percentage discount (without the % symbol) in the 'Rental
   Discount' field

When finished, click 'Add' to save your changes. To modify a rule,
simply click the 'Edit' link to the right of the fule and edit the
values that appear filled in at the bottom of the form.

Edit circ and fine rule
|image158|

If you would like to delete your rule, click the 'Delete' link to the
right of the rule.

To save time you can clone rules from one library to another by choosing
the clone option above the rules matrix.

After choosing to clone you will be presented with a confirmation
message.

`Default Checkouts and Hold Policy <#defaultcheckoutpolicy>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set a default maximum number of checkouts and hold policy that
will be used if none is defined below for a particular item type or
category. This is the fall back rule for defaults.

Default Checkouts and Hold Policy
|image161|

From this menu you can set a default to apply to all item types and
patrons in the library if no other option is set in the forms below.

-  In 'Total current checkouts allowed' enter the total number of items
   patrons can have checked out at one time

-  In 'Total current on-site checkouts allowed' enter the total number
   of items patrons can have checked out on site at a time
   (`OnSiteCheckouts <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__ needs to be set to 'Enable')

-  Control where patrons can place holds from using the 'Hold Policy'
   menu

   -  From Any Library: Patrons from any library may put this item on
      hold. (default if none is defined)

   -  From Home Library: Only patrons from the item's home library may
      put this book on hold.

   -  No Holds Allowed: No patron may put this book on hold.

-  Control if there is a limit to filling a hold based on the item's
   library

   -  any library

   -  item's home library

   -  item's holding library

   -  **Note**

          The patron's home library should not affect whether a patron
          can place the hold, instead the hold will only be fillable
          when an item matching the pickup location becomes available.

-  Control where the item returns to once it is checked in

   -  Item returns home

   -  Item returns to issuing branch

   -  Item floats

      -  When an item floats it stays where it was checked in and does
         not ever return 'home'

-  Once your policy is set, you can unset it by clicking the 'Unset'
   link to the right of the rule

`Checkouts Per Patron <#checkoutperpatron>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this library, you can specify the maximum number of loans that a
patron of a given category can make, regardless of the item type.

Set default checkouts per patron category
|image162|

    **Note**

    If the total amount loanable for a given patron category is left
    blank, no limit applies, except possibly for a limit you define for
    a specific item type.

For example, if you have a rule in the matrix that says Board patrons
are allowed 10 books and 5 DVDs but you want to make it so that Board
patrons only have a total of 12 things checked out at once. If you enter
12 here and the patron has 10 books out already they will only be
allowed 2 DVDs to equal the 12 total they're allowed.

`Item Hold Policies <#holdpolicies>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this library, you can edit hold and return policies for a given item
type, regardless of the patron's category.

Hold policies per item type
|image163|

The various Hold Policies have the following effects:

-  From Any Library: Patrons from any library may put this item on hold.
   (default if none is defined)

-  From Home Library: Only patrons from the item's home library may put
   this book on hold.

-  No Holds Allowed: No patron may put this book on hold.

    **Important**

    Note that if the system preference
    `AllowHoldPolicyOverride <#AllowHoldPolicyOverride>`__ set to
    'allow', these policies can be overridden by your circulation staff.

    **Important**

    These policies are based on the patron's home branch, not the branch
    that the reserving staff member is from.

Control if there is a limit to filling a hold based on the item's
library

-  any library

-  item's home library

-  item's holding library

-  **Note**

       The patron's home library should not affect whether a patron can
       place the hold, instead the hold will only be fillable when an
       item matching the pickup location becomes available.

The various Return Policies have the following effects:

-  Item returns home: The item will prompt the librarian to transfer the
   item to its home library

   -  **Important**

          If the `AutomaticItemReturn <#AutomaticItemReturn>`__
          preference is set to automatically transfer the items home,
          then a prompt will not appear

-  Item returns to issuing branch: The item will prompt the librarian to
   transfer the item back to the library where it was checked out

   -  **Important**

          If the `AutomaticItemReturn <#AutomaticItemReturn>`__
          preference is set to automatically transfer the items home,
          then a prompt will not appear

-  Item floats: The item will not be transferred from the branch it was
   checked in at, instead it will remain there until transferred
   manually or checked in at another branch

For example you might allow holds at your libraries but not what New
items or DVDs to be placed on hold by other branches so you can set the
'Hold policy' to 'From home library' so that those items can only be
placed on hold if the items' owning library and the patron's home
library are the same. You can also block holds completely on specific
item types from this form. This is also how you can set up floating item
types and types that remain with their home library.

`Patron Attribute Types <#patronattributetypes>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron attributes can be used to define custom fields to associate with
your patron records. In order to enable the use of custom fields you
need to set the `ExtendedPatronAttributes <#ExtendedPatronAttributes>`__
system preference.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons & Circulation > Patron
   attribute types

A common use for this field would be for a student ID number or a
Driver's license number.

To add a new Patron Attribute Type, click the 'New Patron Attribute
Type' button at the top of the page

Add Patron Attribute Type form
|image165|

-  In the 'Patron attribute type code', enter a short code to identify
   this field

   -  **Important**

          This field is limited to 10 characters (numbers and letters
          only)

   -  **Important**

          This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined

-  In the 'Description' field, enter a longer (plain text) explanation
   of what this field will contain

-  Check the box next to 'Repeatable' to let a patron record have
   multiple values of this attribute.

   -  **Important**

          This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined

-  If 'Unique identifier' is checked, the attribute will be a unique
   identifier which means, if a value is given to a patron record, the
   same value cannot be given to a different record.

   -  Unique attributes can be used as match points on the `patron
      import tool <#patronimport>`__

   -  **Important**

          This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined

-  Check 'Allow password' to make it possible to associate a password
   with this attribute.

-  Check 'Display in OPAC' to display this attribute on a patron's
   details page in the OPAC.

-  Check 'Searchable' to make this attribute searchable in the staff
   patron search.

-  Check 'Display in check-out' to make this attribute visible in the
   patron's short detail display on the left of the checkout screen and
   other patron pages

   Show attribute in patron detail on the left
   |image166|

-  Authorized value category; if one is selected, the patron record
   input page will only allow values to be chosen from the authorized
   value list.

   -  You will first need to add an authorized value list for it to
      appear in this menu

      -  *Get there:*\ More > Administration > Basic Parameters >
         `Authorized Values <#authorizedvalues>`__

   -  **Important**

          an authorized value list is not enforced during batch patron
          import.

-  If you would like this attribute to only be used by specific branches
   you can choose those branches from the 'Branches limitation' list.
   Choose 'All branches' to show it for all libraries.

   -  **Important**

          Note that items with locations already set on them will not be
          altered. The branch limitation only limits the choosing of an
          authorized value based on the home branch of the current staff
          login. All authorized values for item records (LOC, LOST,
          CCODE, etc) will show in the OPAC for all patrons.

-  If you'd like to only show this attribute on patrons of one type
   choose that patron type from the 'Category' pull down

-  If you have a lot of attributes it might be handy to group them so
   that you can easily find them for editing. If you create an
   `Authorized Value <#authorizedvalues>`__ for PA\_CLASS it will show
   in the 'Class' pull down and you can then change your attributes page
   to have sections of attributes

   Patron Attributes Sorted
   |image167|

-  Click Save to save your new attribute

Once added your attribute will appear on the list of attributes and also
on the patron record add/edit form

Patron Attributes list on the Patron add/edit form
|image168|

If you have set up classes for organizing attributes they will appear
that way on the add/edit patron form

Grouped Attributes
|image169|

`Editing/Deleting Patron Attributes <#editpatattributes>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each patron attribute has an edit and a delete link beside it on the
list of attributes.

Some fields in the attribute will not be editable once created:

-  Patron attribute type code

-  Repeatable

-  Unique identifier

You will be unable to delete an attribute if it's in use.

`Library Transfer Limits <#libtransferlimits>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Limit the ability to transfer items between libraries based on the
library sending, the library receiving, and the collection code
involved.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons & Circulation > Library
   Transfer Limits

These rules only go into effect if the preference
`UseBranchTransferLimits <#UseBranchTransferLimits>`__ is set to
'enforce'.

Before you begin you will want to choose which library you are setting
these limits for.

Choose the library you're setting limits for
|image171|

Transfer limits are set based on the collections codes you have applied
via the `Authorized Value <#authorizedvalues>`__ administration area.

Collection Code values assigned in the Authorized Value area
|image172|

Collection codes will appear as tabs above the checkboxes:

Collection Code tabs
|image173|

Check the boxes for the libraries that you accept checkins from for the
item type you have selected at the top (in the example below - FIC)

Example transfer limits set up
|image174|

In the above example, Centerville library will allow patrons to return
items from all libraries except Liberty and Franklin to their branch.

`Transport cost matrix <#transportcostmatrix>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Transport cost matrix lets a library system define relative costs to
transport books to one another. In order for the system to use this
matrix you must first set the
`UseTransportCostMatrix <#UseTransportCostMatrix>`__ preference to
'Use'.

    **Important**

    The Transport cost matrix takes precedence in controlling where
    holds are filled from, if the matrix is not used then Koha checks
    the `StaticHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__.

Costs are decimal values between some arbitrary maximum value (e.g. 1 or
100) and 0 which is the minimum (no) cost. For example, you could just
use the distance between each library in miles as your 'cost', if that
would accurately reflect the cost of transferring them. Perhaps post
offices would be a better measure. Libraries sharing a post office would
have a cost of 1, adjacent post offices would have a cost of 2, etc.

To enter transport costs simply click in the cell you would like to
alter, uncheck the 'Disable' box and enter your 'cost'

Transport cost matrix
|image175|

After entering in your cost, hit 'Enter' on your keyboard or click the
'Save' button at the bottom of the matrix to save your changes.

    **Note**

    A NULL value will make no difference where the From and To libraries
    are the same library. However, as a best practice, you should put a
    0 in there. For all other To/From combinations, a NULL value will
    cause that relationship to act as if it has been disabled. So, in
    summary, don't leave any of the values empty. It's best to always
    put a number in there ( even if you choose to disable that given
    To/From option ).

`Item Circulation Alerts <#itemcircalerts>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries can decide if they want to have patrons automatically notified
of circulation events (check ins and check outs).

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons & Circulation > Item
   Circulation Alerts

These preferences are set based on patron types and item types.

    **Important**

    These preference can be overridden by changes in the individual
    patron's messaging preferences.

To set up circulation alerts:

-  Choose your library from the pull down at the top of the screen

   Libraries to set Circulation Alerts
   |image176|

   -  To set preferences for all libraries, keep the menu set to
      'Default'

-  By default all item types and all patrons are notified of check ins
   and check outs. To change this, click on the item/patron type combo
   that you would like to stop notices for.

   Circulation Alert Matrix
   |image177|

   -  In the above example, Juveniles and Kids will not receive check
      out notices.

`Cities and Towns <#citytowns>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To standardize patron input you can define cities or towns within your
region so that when new patrons are added librarians simply have to
select the town from a list instead of having to type the town and zip
(or postal) code information.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Patrons & Circulation > Cities
   and Towns

`Adding a City <#addingcity>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new city, click the 'New City' button at the top of the page
and enter the city name, state, zip/postal code and country.

New city entry form
|image178|

One you click Submit, your city will be saved and will be listed on the
Cities and Towns page

List of Cities
|image179|

Cities can be edited or deleted at any time.

`Viewing Cities on Patron Add Form <#citiesonpatform>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have defined local cities using the New city form, then when
adding or editing a patron record you will see those cities in a pull
down menu to make city selection easy.

Cities pull down on the patron record
|image180|

This will allow for easy entry of local cities into the patron record
without risking the potential for typos or mistaken zip/postal codes.

`Catalog Administration <#catadmin>`__
--------------------------------------

Set these controls before you start cataloging on your Koha system.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog

`MARC Bibliographic Frameworks <#marcbibframeworks>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Think of Frameworks as templates for creating new bibliographic records.
Koha comes with some predefined frameworks that can be edited or
deleted, and librarians can create their own frameworks for content
specific to their libraries.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > MARC Bibliographic
   Frameworks

Frameworks List
|image181|

    **Important**

    Do not delete or edit the Default Framework since this will cause
    problems with your cataloging records - always create a new template
    based on the Default Framework, or alter the other Frameworks.

After clicking the 'MARC structure' link to the right of each framework
you can decide how many fields you want to see on one screen by using
the pagination options at the top of the table.

Pagination options
|image182|

`Add New Framework <#addframework>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new framework

-  Click 'New Framework'

   Add Framework Form
   |image183|

   -  Enter a code of 4 or fewer characters

   -  Use the Description field to enter a more detailed definition of
      your framework

-  Click 'Submit'

-  Once your Framework is added click 'MARC structure' to the right of
   it on the list of Frameworks

   Choose basis for new Framework
   |image184|

   -  You will be asked to choose a Framework to base your new Framework
      off of, this will make it easier than starting from scratch

-  Once your Framework appears on the screen you can edit or delete each
   field by following the instructions for `editing
   subfields <#editsubfields>`__

`Edit Existing Frameworks <#editframeworks>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clicking 'Edit' to the right of a Framework will only allow you to edit
the Description for the Framework:

Edit Framework
|image185|

To make edits to the fields associated with the Framework you must first
click 'MARC Structure' and then follow the instructions for `editing
subfields <#editsubfields>`__

`Add subfields to Frameworks <#addsubfieldsframework>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a field to a Framework click the 'New Tag' button at the top of
the Framework definition

New Tag Button
|image186|

This will open up a blank form for entering MARC field data

Add a new tag to framework
|image187|

Enter the information about your new tag:

-  The 'Tag' is the MARC field number

-  The 'Label for lib' is the text that will appear in the staff client
   when in the cataloging module

-  The 'Label for OPAC' is the text that will appear in the OPAC when
   viewing the MARC version of the record

-  If this field can be repeated, check the 'Repeatable' box

-  If this field is mandatory, check the 'Mandatory' box

-  If you want this field to be a pull down with limited possible
   answers, choose which 'Authorized value' list you want to use

When you're finished, click 'Save Changes' and you will be presented
with your new field

New tag and link to subfields
|image188|

To the right of the new field is a link to 'Subfields,' you will need to
add subfields before this tag will appear in your MARC editor. The
process of entering the settings for the new subfield is the same as
those found in the `editing subfields in frameworks <#editsubfields>`__
section of this manual.

`Edit Framework Subfields <#editsubfields>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Frameworks are made up of MARC fields and subfields. To make edits to
most Frameworks you must edit the fields and subfields. Clicking 'Edit'
to the right of each subfield will allow you to make changes to the text
associated with the field

Modify MARC Field
|image189|

-  Each field has a tag (which is the MARC tag) that is uneditable

   -  The 'Label for lib' is what will show in the staff client if you
      have `advancedMARCeditor <#advancedMARCeditor>`__ set to display
      labels

   -  The 'Label for OPAC' is what will show on the MARC view in the
      OPAC

   -  If you check 'Repeatable' then the field will have a plus sign
      next to it allowing you to add multiples of that tag

   -  If you check 'Mandatory' the record will not be allowed to save
      unless you have a value assigned to this tag

   -  'Authorized value' is where you define an `authorized
      value <#authorizedvalues>`__ that your catalogers can choose from
      a pull down to fill this field in

To edit the subfields associated with the tag, click 'Subfields' to the
right of the tag on the 'MARC Structure' listing

-  From the list of subfields you can click 'Delete' to the right of
   each to delete the subfields

-  To edit the subfields click 'Edit Subfields'

-  For each subfield you can set the following Basic constraint values

   Editing the 504 Subfield
   |image190|

   -  Text for librarian

      -  what appears before the subfield in the librarian interface

   -  Text for OPAC

      -  what appears before the field in the OPAC.

         -  If left empty, the text for librarian is used instead

   -  Repeatable

      -  the field will have a plus sign next to it allowing you to add
         multiples of that tag

   -  Mandatory

      -  the record will not be allowed to save unless you have a value
         assigned to this tag

   -  Managed in tab

      -  defines the tab where the subfield is shown. All subfields of a
         given field must be in the same tab or ignored. Ignore means
         that the subfield is not managed.

-  For each subfield you can set the following Advanced constraint
   values

   Advanced constraints
   |image191|

   -  Default value

      -  defines what you want to appear in the field by default, this
         will be editable, but it saves time if you use the same note
         over and over or the same value in a field often.

      -  **Note**

             If you would like a field to fill in with today's date you
             can use the YYYY MM DD syntax in the 'Default value'. For
             example: a default of "Year:YYYY Month:MM Day:DD" (without
             quotes) will print as "Year:2015 Month:11 Day:30"

   -  Visibility

      -  allows you to select from where this subfield is
         visible/hidden, simply check the boxes where you would like the
         field to show and uncheck the boxes where you would like it
         hidden.

         Framework visibility
         |image192|

   -  Is a URL

      -  if checked, it means that the subfield is a URL and can be
         clicked

   -  Link

      -  If you enter a field/subfield here (200b), a link appears after
         the subfield in the MARC Detail view. This view is present only
         in the staff client, not the OPAC. If the librarian clicks on
         the link, a search is done on the database for the
         field/subfield with the same value. This can be used for 2 main
         topics :

         -  on a field like author (200f in UNIMARC), put 200f here, you
            will be able to see all bib records with the same author.

         -  on a field that is a link (4xx) to reach another bib record.
            For example, put 011a in 464$x, will find the serials that
            are with this ISSN.

      -  **Warning**

             This value should not change after data has been added to
             your catalog. If you need to change this value you must ask
             your system administrator to run
             misc/batchRebuildBiblioTables.pl.

   -  Koha link

      -  Koha is multi-MARC compliant. So, it does not know what the
         245$a means, neither what 200$f (those 2 fields being both the
         title in MARC21 and UNIMARC). So, in this list you can "map" a
         MARC subfield to its meaning. Koha constantly maintains
         consistency between a subfield and its meaning. When the user
         want to search on "title", this link is used to find what is
         searched (245 if you're MARC21, 200 if you're UNIMARC).

-  For each subfield you can set the following Other option values

   |image193|

   -  Authorized value

      -  means the value cannot by typed by the librarian, but must be
         chosen from a pull down generated by the `authorized
         value <#authorizedvalues>`__ list

      -  In the example above, the 504a field will show the MARC504
         Authorized Values when cataloging

         Example of an Authorized Subfield
         |image194|

   -  Thesaurus

      -  means that the value is not free text, but must be searched in
         the authority/thesaurus of the selected category

   -  Plugin

      -  means the value is calculated or managed by a plugin. Plugins
         can do almost anything.

      -  Examples:

         -  For call numbers there is an option to add a call number
            browser next to the the call number subfield so that you can
            identify which call numbers are in use and which are not.
            Simply choose the cn\_browser.pl plugin. Learn more in the
            `cataloging section <#addingitems>`__ of this manual.

         -  If you'd like to let file uploads via cataloging you can
            choose the upload.pl plugin and this will allow you to
            `upload files to Koha to link to your
            records <#uploadbibfile>`__.

         -  In UNIMARC there are plugins for every 1xx fields that are
            coded fields. The plugin is a huge help for cataloger! There
            are also two plugins (unimarc\_plugin\_210c and
            unimarc\_plugin\_225a that can "magically" find the editor
            from an ISBN, and the collection list for the editor)

-  To save your changes simply click the 'Save Changes' button at the
   top of the screen

`Import/Export Frameworks <#importexportframeworks>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next to each framework is a link to either import or export the
framework.

`Export Framework <#exportframeworks>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To export a framework simply click the 'Export' link to the right of
framework title.

Export link next to framework
|image195|

When you click 'Export' you will be prompted to choose what format to
export the file in.

Export formats
|image196|

A framework exported this way can be imported into any other Koha
installation using the import framework option.

`Import Framework <#importframeworks>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

An easy way to create a new framework is to import one created for your
or another Koha installation. This framework would need to be exported
from the other system `using the instructions
above <#exportframeworks>`__ to be available for import here.

To import a framework you first need to create `a new
framework <#addframework>`__. Once you have that framework, click
'Import' to the right of the new framework.

Import link next to framework
|image197|

You will be prompted to find a file on your computer to import into the
framework.

Choose a file to import
|image198|

You will be asked to confirm your actions before the file is imported.

Confirm your desire to import
|image199|

As your file is uploaded you will see an image that will confirm that
the system is working.

Import timer
|image200|

Once your import is complete you will be brought to the framework edit
tool where you can make any changes you need to the framework you
imported.

`Koha to MARC Mapping <#kohamarcmapping>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While Koha stores the entire MARC record, it also stores common fields
for easy access in various tables in the database. Koha to MARC Mapping
is used to tell Koha where to find these values in the MARC record. In
many cases you will not have to change the default values set by in this
tool on installation, but it is important to know that the tool is here
and can be used at any time.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > Koha to MARC Mapping

The Koha to MARC Mapping page offers you the option of choosing from one
of three tables in the database to assign values to.

Koha to MARC Mapping Table Pull Down
|image201|

After choosing the table you would like to view, click 'OK.' To edit any
mapping click on the 'Koha Filed' or the 'Edit' link.

Map MARC Field to Koha Field
|image202|

Choose which MARC field you would like to map to this Koha Field and
click the 'OK' button. If you would like to clear all mappings, click
the 'Click to "Unmap"' button.

    **Important**

    At this time you can map only 1 MARC field to 1 Koha field. This
    means that you won't be able to map both the 100a and the 700a to
    the author field, you need to choose one or the other.

`Keywords to MARC Mapping <#keywordmapping>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool will allow you to map MARC fields to a set of predefined
keywords.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > Keywords to MARC
   Mapping

    **Important**

    This tool only effects sites that are not using the XSLT
    Stylesheets.

At this time the only keyword in use is 'subtitle.'

Using this tool you can define what MARC field prints to the detail
screen of the bibliographic record using keywords. The following example
will use the subtitle field.

Using the Framework pull down menu, choose the
`Framework <#marcbibframeworks>`__ you would like to apply this rule to.
For example, the subtitle for books can be found in the 245$b field.

Assigning Book Subtitle
|image203|

However the subtitle for DVDs appears in 245$p

Assigning DVD Subtitle
|image204|

Using this tool you can tell Koha to print the right field as the
subtitle when viewing the bibliographic record in the OPAC.

Subtitle display in the OPAC
|image205|

This tool can be used to chain together pieces of the record as well. If
you want the series number to show in the title on your search results
you simply have to map 490 $v to 'subtitle' along with the 245 $b.

    **Note**

    Chain together the fields you want to show after the item title in
    the order in which you want them to appear.

Future developments will include additional keyword assigned fields.

`MARC Bibliographic Framework Test <#marcbibframeworkstest>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checks the MARC structure.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > MARC Bibliographic
   Framework Test

If you change your MARC Bibliographic framework it's recommended that
you run this tool to test for errors in your definition.

Framework Test
|image206|

`Authority Types <#authoritiesadmin>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authority Types are basically MARC Frameworks for Authority records and
because of that they follow the same editing rules found in the `MARC
Bibliographic Frameworks <#marcbibframeworks>`__ section of this manual.
Koha comes with many of the necessary Authority frameworks already
installed. To learn how to add and edit Authority Types, simply review
the `MARC Bibliographic Frameworks <#marcbibframeworks>`__ section of
this manual.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > Authority Types

`Classification Sources <#classificationsources>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source of classification or shelving scheme is an `Authorized
Values <#authorizedvalues>`__ category that is mapped to field 952$2 and
942$2 in Koha's MARC Bibliographic frameworks and stored in the
items.cn\_source field in the database.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > Classification sources

Classification Sources
|image207|

Commonly used values of this field are:

-  ddc - Dewey Decimal Classification

-  lcc - Library of Congress Classification

If you chose to install classification sources during Koha's
installation, you would see other values too:

-  ANSCR (sound recordings)

-  SuDOC classification

-  Universal Decimal Classification

-  Other/Generic Classification

`Adding/Editing Classification Sources <#addingclasssource>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add your own source of classification by using the New
Classification Source button. To edit use the Edit link.

Add classification source
|image208|

When creating or editing:

-  You will need to enter a code and a description.

-  Check the 'Source in use?' checkbox if you want the value to appear
   in the drop down list for this category.

-  Select the appropriate `filing rule <#classfilingrules>`__ from the
   drop down list.

`Classification Filing Rules <#classfilingrules>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Filing rules determine the order in which items are placed on shelves.

Values that are pre-configured in Koha are:

-  Dewey

-  LCC

-  Generic

Filing rules are mapped to `Classification
sources <#addingclasssource>`__. You can setup new filing rules by using
the New Filing Rule button. To edit use the Edit link.

When creating or editing:

-  Enter a code and a description

-  Choose an appropriate filing routine - dewey, generic or lcc

`Record Matching Rules <#recordmatchingrules>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Record matching rules are used when importing MARC records into Koha.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Catalog > Record Matching Rules

The rules that you set up here will be referenced with you `Stage MARC
Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__.

It is important to understand the difference between Match Points and
Match Checks before adding new matching rules to Koha.

Match Points are the criteria that you enter that must be met in order
for an incoming record to match an existing MARC record in your catalog.
You can have multiple match points on an import rule each with its own
score. An incoming record will be compared against your existing records
(‘one record at a time’) and given a score for each match point. When
the total score of the matchpoints matches or exceeds the threshold
given for the matching rule, Koha assumes a good match and
imports/overlays according your specifications in the import process. An
area to watch out for here is the sum of the match points. Doublecheck
that the matches you want will add up to a successful match.

Example:

Threshold of 1000

Match Point on 020$a 1000

Match Point on 022$a 1000

Match Point on 245$a 500

Match Point on 100$a 100

In the example above, a match on either the 020$a or the 022$a will
result in a successful match. A match on 245$a title and 100$a author
(and not on 020$a or 022$a) will only add up to 600 and not be a match.
And a match on 020$a and 245$a will result in 1500 and while this is a
successful match, the extra 500 point for the 245$a title match are
superfluous. The incoming record successfully matched on the 020$a
without the need for the 245$a match. However, if you assigned a score
of 500 to the 100$a Match Point, a match on 245$a title and 100$a author
will be considered a successful match (total of 1000) even if the 020$a
is not a match.

Match Checks are not commonly used in import rules. However, they can
serve a couple of purposes in matching records. First, match checks can
be used as the matching criteria instead of the match points if your
indexes are stale and out of date. The match checks go right for the
data instead of relying on the data in the indexes. (If you fear your
indexes are out of date, a rebuild of your indexes would be a great idea
and solve that situation!) The other use for a Match Check is as a
“double check” or “veto” of your matching rule. For example, if you have
a matching rule as below:

Threshold of 1000

Match Point on 020$a 1000

Match Check on 245$a

Koha will first look at the 020$a tag/subfield to see if the incoming
record matches an existing record. If it does, it will then move on to
the Match Check and look directly at the 245$a value in the incoming
data and compare it to the 245$a in the existing ‘matched’ record in
your catalog. If the 245$a matches, Koha continues on as if a match was
successful. If the 245$a does not match, then Koha concludes that the
two records are not a match after all. The Match Checks can be a really
useful tool in confirming true matches.

When looking to create matching rules for your authority records the
following indexes will be of use:

+--------------------------+--------------------+
| Index name               | Matches Marc Tag   |
+==========================+====================+
| LC-cardnumber            | 010$a              |
+--------------------------+--------------------+
| Personal-name            | 100$a              |
+--------------------------+--------------------+

`Adding Matching Rules <#addrecordmatchrule>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new matching rule :

-  Click 'New Record Matching Rule'

   Add record matching rule
   |image209|

   -  Choose a unique name and enter it in the 'Matching rule code'
      field

   -  'Description' can be anything you want to make it clear to you
      what rule you're picking

   -  'Match threshold' is the total number of 'points' a biblio must
      earn to be considered a 'match'

   -  'Record type' is the type of import this rule will be used for -
      either authority or bibliographic

   -  Match points are set up to determine what fields to match on

   -  'Search index' can be found by looking at the ccl.properties file
      on your system which tells the zebra indexing what data to search
      for in the MARC data".

   -  'Score' - The number of 'points' a match on this field is worth.
      If the sum of each score is greater than the match threshold, the
      incoming record is a match to the existing record

   -  Enter the MARC tag you want to match on in the 'Tag' field

   -  Enter the MARC tag subfield you want to match on in the
      'Subfields' field

   -  'Offset' - For use with control fields, 001-009

   -  'Length' - For use with control fields, 001-009

   -  Koha only has one 'Normalization rule' that removes extra
      characters such as commas and semicolons. The value you enter in
      this field is irrelevant to the normalization process.

   -  'Required match checks' - ??

`Sample Bibliographic Record Matching Rule: Control Number <#samplerecordmatch>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LOC Matching Rule
|image210|

-  Match threshold: 100

-  Record type: Bibliographic

   -  **Note**

          If you'd like a rule to match on the 001 in authority records
          you will need the repeat all of these values and change just
          the record type to 'Authority record'

-  Matchpoints (just the one):

-  Search index: Control-number

-  Score: 101

-  Tag: 001

   -  **Note**

          this field is for the control number assigned by the
          organization creating, using, or distributing the record

-  Subfields: a

-  Offset: 0

-  Length: 0

-  Normalization rule: Control-number

-  Required Match checks: none (remove the blank one)

`OAI Sets Configuration <#oaisetsconfig>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On this page you can create, modify and delete OAI-PMH sets

`Create a set <#oaicreate>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a set:

-  Click on the link 'Add a new set'

-  Fill the mandatory fields 'setSpec' and 'setName'

-  Then you can add descriptions for this set. To do this click on 'Add
   description' and fill the newly created text box. You can add as many
   descriptions as you want.

-  Click on 'Save' button'

`Modify/Delete a set <#oaimodify>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To modify a set, just click on the link 'Modify' on the same line of the
set you want to modify. A form similar to set creation form will appear
and allow you to modify the setSpec, setName and descriptions.

To delete a set, just click on the link 'Delete' on the same line of the
set you want to delete.

`Define mappings <#oaimapping>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here you can define how a set will be build (what records will belong to
this set) by defining mappings. Mappings are a list of conditions on
record content. A record only need to match one condition to belong to
the set.

-  Fill the fields 'Field', 'Subfield' and 'Value'. For example if you
   want to include in this set all records that have a 999$9 equal to
   'XXX'. Fill 'Field' with 999, 'Subfield' with 9 and 'Value' with XXX.

-  If you want to add another condition, click on 'OR' button and repeat
   step 1.

-  Click on 'Save'

To delete a condition, just leave at least one of 'Field', 'Subfield' or
'Value' empty and click on 'Save'.

    **Note**

    Actually, a condition is true if value in the corresponding subfield
    is strictly equal to what is defined if 'Value'. A record having
    999$9 = 'XXX YYY' will not belong to a set where condition is 999$9
    = 'XXX'.

And it is case sensitive : a record having 999$9 = 'xxx' will not belong
to a set where condition is 999$9 = 'XXX'.

`Build sets <#oaibuild>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have configured all your sets, you have to build the sets. This
is done by calling the script misc/migration\_tools/build\_oai\_sets.pl.

`Item search fields <#itemsearchadmin>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From here you can add custom search fields to the `item
search <#searchguide-itemsearch>`__ option in the staff client. Item
search fields

To add a new search term simply click the 'New search field' buttonAdd
new field

-  Name is a field for you to identify the search term

-  Label is what will appear on the item search page

-  MARC field allows you to pick which field you'd like to search in

-  MARC subfield is the subfield you'd like to search in

-  Authorised values category can be used to turn this search field in
   to a pull down instead of a free text field

Once your new field is added it will be visible at the top of this page
and on the item search pageSearch option

`Acquisitions <#acqadmin>`__
----------------------------

The Koha Acquisitions module provides a way for the library to record
orders placed with vendors and manage purchase budgets.

Before using the `Acquisitions Module <#acqmodule>`__, you will want to
make sure that you have completed all of the set up.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Acquisitions

`Currencies and Exchange Rates <#currexchangeadmin>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you place orders from more than one country you will want to input
currency exchange rates so that your acquisitions module will properly
calculate totals.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Acquisitions > Currencies and
   Exchange Rates

Currencies
|image212|

    **Note**

    This data is not automatically updated, so be sure to keep it up to
    date so that your accounting is kept correct.

The ISO code you enter will be used when importing MARC files via the
staging tools, the tool will attempt to find and use the price of the
currently active currency.

The active currency is the main currency you use in your library. Your
active currency will have a check mark in the 'Active' column. If you
don't have an active currency you will see an error message telling you
to choose an active currency.

No active currency warning
|image213|

`Budgets <#budgetplanning>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Budgets are used for tracking accounting values related to acquisitions.
For example you could create a Budget for the current year (ex. 2015)
and then break that into `Funds <#funds>`__ for different areas of the
library (ex. Books, Audio, etc).

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Acquisitions > Budgets

When visiting the main budget administration you will see two tabs, one
for active and one for inactive budgets.

Budgets List
|image214|

`Adding budgets <#addbudget>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Budgets can either be created `from scratch <#addnewbudget>`__, by
`duplicating the previous year's budget <#duplicatebudget>`__ or by
`closing a previous year's budget <#closebudget>`__.

`Add a new budget <#addnewbudget>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you haven't used Koha before for acquisitions then you'll need to
start fresh with a new budget. To add a new budget click the 'New
Budget' button.

New Budget Form
|image215|

-  Choose the time period this budget is for, whether it's an academic
   year, a fiscal year, a quarter, etc.

-  The Description should be something that will help you identify the
   budget when ordering

-  In the amount box do not use any symbols, simply enter the amount of
   the budget with numbers and decimals.

-  Marking a budget active makes it usable when placing orders in the
   acquisitions module, even if the order is placed after the budget end
   date. This will allow you to record orders that were places in a
   previous budget period.

-  Locking a budget means that Funds will not be able to be modified by
   librarians

Once you have made your edits, click the 'Save Changes' button. You will
be brought to a list of your existing budgets.

List of Budgets
|image216|

`Duplicate a budget <#duplicatebudget>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To duplicate a budget from a previous year, click on the link for the
budget name from the list of budgets

Budgets List
|image217|

On the screen listing the budget breakdown click the Edit button at the
top and choose to Duplicate budget

Duplicate Budget
|image218|

You can also click the 'Actions' button to the right of the budget and
choose 'Duplicate'.Duplicate budget

In both cases you will be presented with a form where you simply need to
enter the new start and end date and save the budget.

New Duplicate Budget
|image219|

Check the box for 'Mark the original budget as inactive' if the original
budget should no longer be used.

Check the box for 'Set all funds to zero' if you wish the new budget to
contain all the same fund structures as the previous budget but no
allocations until you manually enter an amount in the fund.

This will not only duplicate your budget, but all of the funds
associated with that budget so that you can reuse budgets and funds from
year to year and so that you can move unreceived orders and if desired
unspent funds from a previous budget to the new budget.

`Close a budget <#closebudget>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Close a budget to move or roll over unreceived orders and if desired
unspent funds from a previous budget to a new budget. Before closing
your budget you might want to `duplicate the previous year's
budget <#duplicatebudget>`__ so that you have somewhere for the
unreceived orders to roll to.

Find the previous budget with unreceived orders on the Active budgets or
the Inactive budgets tab and select 'Close' under 'Actions'. Close a
budget

    **Note**

    In order for the unreceived orders to be automatically moved to the
    new budget, the fund structures in the previous budget must exist in
    the new budget. Budgets without unreceived orders cannot be closed.

When you select 'Close' you will be presented with a form.Closing a
budget

Use the 'Select a budget' drop down to choose the new budget for the
unreceived orders.

Check the box for 'Move remaining unspent funds' to move the unspent
amounts from the funds of the budget being closed to the selected
budget.

Once you have made your choices, click the 'Move unreceived orders'
button. You will be presented with a dialog box that says 'You have
chosen to move all unreceived orders from 'Budget X' to 'Budget Y'. This
action cannot be reversed. Do you wish to continue?' Budget X is the
budget to be closed and Budget Y is the selected budget. Close warning

If everything seems correct click 'OK' and the unreceived orders and, if
selected, unspent funds will be moved.

Wait until the 'Report after moving unreceived orders from budget X to
Y' displays. This will list the order numbers which have been impacted
(grouped by fund) and detail if the unreceived order was moved or if
there was a problem. For example, if the new budget does not contain a
fund with the same name as the previous budget, the order will not be
moved.

-  You can choose to assign this fund to a librarian. Doing so will make
   it so that only that librarian can make changes to the Fund

-  Choose which library will be using this fund

-  You can restrict who can order from this fund by choosing either the
   'owner', 'owner and users' or 'owner, users and library' from the
   'Restrict access to' menu

   Restrict Fund Access
   |image223|

   -  **Important**

          Without an owner, the access restriction will be ignored, be
          sure to enter an owner as well as choose a restriction

-  Notes are simply for any descriptive notes you might want to add so
   that librarians know when to use this fund

-  Planning categories are used for statistical purposes. To learn more
   about planning categories, check out the `Planning Category
   FAQ <#planningcatfaq>`__.

When complete, click 'Submit' and you will be brought to a list of all
of the funds for the budget.

List of funds
|image224|

The monetary columns in the fund table break down as follows:

1. Base-level allocated is the "Amount" value you defined when creating
   the fund

2. Base-level ordered is the ordered amount for this fund (without child
   funds)

3. Total ordered is the base-level ordered for this fund and all its
   child funds

4. Base-level spent is the spent amount for this fund (without child
   funds)

5. Total spent is the base-level spent for this fund and all its child
   funds

6. Base-level available is 1 - 2

7. Total available is 1 - 3

To the right of each fund you will find the 'Actions' button under which
you will find the 'Edit,' 'Delete,' and 'Add Child Fund' options.

Z39.50 is a client–server protocol for searching and retrieving
information from remote computer databases, in short it's a tool used
for copy cataloging.

SRU- Search/Retrieve via URL - is a standard XML-based protocol for
search queries, utilizing CQL - Contextual Query Language - a standard
syntax for representing queries.

Using Koha you can connect to any Z39.50 or SRU target that is publicly
available or that you have the log in information to and copy both
bibliographic and/or authority records from that source.

your `authorities <#catauthorities>`__.

    **Important**

    Did you mean? only works in the OPAC at this time. The Intranet
    options are here for future development.

Using this page you can control which options Koha gives patrons on
their search results.

Did you mean?
|image235|

To turn on the 'Did you mean?' bar on your search results you need to
check the box next to each plugin you would like to use. The two plugins
you have to choose from are:

-  The ExplodedTerms plugin suggests that the user try searching for
   broader/narrower/related terms for a given search (e.g. a user
   searching for "New York (State)" would click the link for narrower
   terms if they're also interested in "New York (City)"). This is only
   relevant for libraries with highly hierarchical authority data.

-  The AuthorityFile plugin searches the authority file and suggests the
   user might be interested in bibs linked to the top 5 authorities

If you want one plugin to take priority over another you simply drag it
above the other.

Drag and drop options
|image236|

If you choose both plugins you will see several options at the top of
your search results

Both plugins
|image237|

If you choose just the AuthorityFile you'll see just authorities.

`Audio alerts <#audioadmin>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have your `AudioAlerts <#AudioAlerts>`__ preference set to
'Enable' you will be able to control the various alert sounds that Koha
uses from this area.

-  *Get there:* More > Administration > Additional Parameters > Audio
   alerts

Each dialog box in Koha has a CSS class assigned to it that can be used
as a selector for a sound.Audio alerts

You can edit the defaults by clicking the 'Edit' button to the right of
each alertEdit alert

You can assign alerts to other CSS classes in Koha by entering that
information in the selector box. For example if you enter

::

    body:contains('Check in message')

Then when you visit the checkin page you will hear an alert.

Every page in Koha has a unique ID in the body tag which can be used to
limit a sound to a specific page

Any ID selector (where html contains id="name\_of\_id" ) and can also be
a trigger as: #name\_of\_selector

`SMS cellular providers <#smsadmin>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Important**

    This option will only appear if the
    `SMSSendDriver <#SMSSendDriver>`__ preference is set to 'Email'

From here you can enter as many cellular providers as you need to send
SMS notices to your patrons using the email protocol.SMS Providers

The patron import tool can be used at any time to add patrons in bulk.
It is commonly used in universities and schools when a new batch of
students registers.

`Creating Patron File <#createpatronfile>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your Koha installation comes with a blank CSV file that you can use as a
template for your patron records. If you would like to create the file
yourself, make sure that your file has the following fields in this
order as the header row:

cardnumber, surname, firstname, title, othernames, initials,
streetnumber, streettype, address, address2, city, state, zipcode,
country, email, phone, mobile, fax, emailpro, phonepro, B\_streetnumber,
B\_streettype, B\_address, B\_address2, B\_city, B\_state, B\_zipcode,
B\_country, B\_email, B\_phone, dateofbirth, branchcode, categorycode,
dateenrolled, dateexpiry, gonenoaddress, lost, debarred,
debarredcomment, contactname, contactfirstname, contacttitle,
guarantorid, borrowernotes, relationship, ethnicity, ethnotes, sex,
password, flags, userid, opacnote, contactnote, sort1, sort2,
altcontactfirstname, altcontactsurname, altcontactaddress1,
altcontactaddress2, altcontactaddress3, altcontactstate,
altcontactzipcode, altcontactcountry, altcontactphone, smsalertnumber,
privacy, patron\_attributes

    **Important**

    The 'password' should be stored in plaintext, and will be converted
    to a Bcrypt hash.

    If your passwords are already encrypted, talk to your systems
    administrator about options

    **Important**

    Date formats should match your `system preference <#dateformat>`__,
    and must be zero-padded, e.g. '01/02/2008'.

    **Important**

    The fields 'branchcode', 'categorycode' and all fields you have
    defined in the `BorrowerMandatoryField <#BorrowerMandatoryField>`__
    preference are required and must match valid entries in your
    database.

    **Note**

    If loading `patron attributes <#patronattributetypes>`__, the
    'patron\_attributes' field should contain a comma-separated list of
    attribute types and values.

    -  The attribute type code and a colon should precede each value.

       -  For example: "INSTID:12345,BASEBALL:Cubs"

       -  This field must be wrapped in quotes if multiple values are
          defined.

       -  Since values can contain spaces, additional doubled-quotes may
          be required:

          -  "INSTID:12345,BASEBALL:Cubs,""BASEBALL:White Sox"""

       -  When replacing a patron record, any attributes specified in
          the input file replace all of the attribute values of any type
          that were previously assigned to the patron record.

`Importing Patrons <#importpatrons>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have created your file, you can use the Patron Import Tool to
bring the data into Koha.

-  Choose your CSV file

   Import Patron Form
   |image255|

-  Choose to match on 'Cardnumber' or 'Username' to prevent adding of
   duplicate card numbers to the system

   Patron match options
   |image256|

-  Next you can choose default values to apply to all patrons you are
   importing

   -  ex. If you're importing patrons specific to one branch you can use
      the field on the Import form to apply the branch code to all those
      you are importing.

-  Finally you need to decide on what data you want to replace if there
   are duplicates.

   If match found
   |image257|

   -  A matching record is found using the field you chose for matching
      criteria to prevent duplication

   -  If you included patron attributes in your file you can decide
      whether to add your values to existing values or erase existing
      values and enter only your new values.

`Notices & Slips <#notices>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patrons and Circulation > Notices & Slips

All notices and circulation receipts (or slips) generated by Koha can be
customized using the Notices & Slips Tool. The system comes with several
predefined templates that will appear when you first visit this tool.

Notices & Slips Tool
|image258|

Each notice can be edited, but only a few can be deleted, this is to
prevent system errors should a message try to send without a template.
Each notice and slip can be edited on a per library basis, by default
you will see the notices for all libraries.

If you have a style you'd like applied to all slips you can point the
`SlipCSS <#SlipCSS>`__ preference to a stylesheet. The same is true for
notices, using the `NoticeCSS <#NoticeCSS>`__ preference to define a
stylesheet.

You will also want to review the `Notices & Slips Field
Guide <#noticesfieldguide>`__ for more information on formatting these
notices.

`Adding Notices & Slips <#addnotices>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new notice or slip

-  Click 'New Notice'

   New Notice Form
   |image259|

-  Choose which library this notice or slip is for

   -  **Important**

          Not all notices can be branch specific for more information
          review the `Notices & Slips Field
          Guide <#noticesfieldguide>`__ in this manual.

-  Choose the module this notice is related to

-  The Code is limited to 20 characters

   -  **Important**

          When working with the overdue notices you want each notice at
          each branch to have a unique code. Think about using the
          branch code in front of the notice code for each branch.

-  Use the name field to expand on your Code

   -  **Note**

          With overdue notices, be sure to put your branch name in the
          description as well so that it will be visible when setting up
          your `triggers <#noticetriggers>`__.

-  Next you can customize the notice for every possible delivery method

   -  Every notice should have an Email template set for itNew Email
      notice

   -  If you're using the
      `TalkingTechItivaPhoneNotification <#TalkingTechItivaPhoneNotification>`__
      service you can set up a Phone notificationNew Phone notice

   -  If you plan on printing this notice you can set the Print template
      nextNew Print notice

   -  If you have enabled SMS notices with the
      `SMSSendDriver <#SMSSendDriver>`__ preference you can set the text
      for your SMS notices nextNew SMS notice

-  Each notice offers you the same options

   -  If you plan on writing the notice or slip in HTML check the 'HTML
      Message' box, otherwise the content will be generated as plain
      text

   -  Message Subject is what will appear in the subject line of the
      email

   -  In the message body feel free to type whatever message you feel is
      best, use the fields on the left hand side to enter individualized
      data from the from database.

      -  **Note**

             Review the `Notices & Slip Field
             Guide <#noticesfieldguide>`__ for info on what fields can
             be used here.

      -  **Important**

             Overdue notices can use <<items.content>> tags by
             themselves, or use <item></item> to span all of the tags.
             Learn more about the `Overdue Notice
             Markup <#noticemarkup>`__

             -  On overdue notices make sure to use <<items.content>>
                tags to print out the data related to all items that are
                overdue.

             -  The other option, only for overdue notices, is to use
                the <item></item> tags to span the line so that it will
                print out multiple lines One example for the
                <item></item> tag option is:

                <item>"<<biblio.title>>" by <<biblio.author>>,
                <<items.itemcallnumber>>, Barcode: <<items.barcode>> ,
                Checkout date: <<issues.issuedate>>, Due date:
                <<issues.date\_due>> Fine: <<items.fine>> Due date:
                <<issues.date\_due>> </item>

      -  **Important**

             Only the overdue notices take advantage of the
             <item></item> tags, all other notices referencing items
             need to use <<items.content>>

      -  **Note**

             To add today's date you can use the <<today>> syntax

      -  **Note**

             If you don't want to print the patron's full name on your
             slips or notice you can enter data in the Other name or
             Initials field for each patron and use that value instead.

`Overdue Notice Markup <#noticemarkup>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When creating your overdue notices there are two tags in addition to the
various database fields that you can use in your notices. You will also
want to review the `Notices & Slips Field Guide <#noticesfieldguide>`__
for information on formatting item information in these notices.

    **Important**

    These new tags only work on the overdue notices, not other
    circulation related notices at this time.

These tags are <item> and </item> which should enclose all fields from
the biblio, biblioitems, and items tables.

An example of using these tags in a notice template might be like:

::

       The following item(s) is/are currently overdue:

       <item>"<<biblio.title>>" by <<biblio.author>>, <<items.itemcallnumber>>, Barcode: <<items.barcode>> Fine: <<items.fine>></item>

Which, assuming two items were overdue, would result in a notice like:

::

       The following item(s) is/are currently overdue:

       "A Short History of Western Civilization" by Harrison, John B, 909.09821 H2451, Barcode: 08030003 Fine: 3.50
       "History of Western Civilization" by Hayes, Carlton Joseph Huntley, 909.09821 H3261 v.1, Barcode: 08030004 Fine: 3.50

these messages.

    **Important**

    In order to have overdue notices sent to your patrons, you need to
    `set that patron category <#addingpatroncat>`__ to require overdue
    notices.

    **Important**

    Depending on the value of your
    `OverdueNoticeCalendar <#OverdueNoticeCalendar>`__ preference the
    delay may or may not include days the library is closed based on the
    `holiday calendar <#calholidays>`__.

The Overdue Notice/Status Triggers tool gives the librarian the power to
send up to three notices to each patron type notifying them of overdue
items

Overdue Notice/Status Triggers Tool
|image260|

-  Delay is the number of days after an issue is due before an action is
   triggered.

   -  **Important**

          If you want Koha to trigger an action (send a letter or
          restrict member), a delay value is required.

-  To send additional notices, click on the tabs for 'Second' and
   'Third' notice

-  If you would like to prevent a patron from checking items out because
   of their overdue items, check the 'Restrict' box, this will put a
   notice on the patron's record at checkout informing the librarian
   that the patron cannot check out due to overdue items.

   -  If you choose to restrict a patron in this way you can also have
      Koha automatically remove that restriction with the
      `AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions <#AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions>`__
      preference.

-  Next you can choose the delivery method for the overdue notice. You
   can choose from Email, Phone (if you are using the `iTiva Talking
   Tech service <#TalkingTechItivaPhoneNotification>`__), Print and SMS
   (if you have set your `SMSSendDriver <#SMSSendDriver>`__).

   -  **Note**

          The Feed option is not yet a feature in Koha, it is there for
          future development.

`Patron Card Creator <#patroncardcreator>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron Card Creator

The Patron Card Creator allow you to use layouts and templates which you
design to print your custom patron cards on your printer. Here are some
of the features of the Patron Card Creator module:

-  Customize patron card layouts with text retrieved from the Koha
   patron data

-  Design custom card templates for printed patron cards (to match the
   label sheets)

-  Build and manage batches of patron cards to print

-  Export (as PDF) single or multiple batches to print

-  Export (as PDF) single or multiple patron cards from within a batch

`Layouts <#cardlayouts>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron Card Creator > Manage > Layouts

A layout defines the text and images that will be printed on to the card
and where it will appear.

    **Note**

    Up to three lines of text, the patron's number in barcode
    representation and up to two images can be printed on to the card.

`Add a Layout <#addcardlayout>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you have no layouts defined, you will add a new layout by clicking
the 'New' button and choosing 'Layout'.New layout button

You may also choose to press 'Manage layout' on the left side. Here you
are offered a list of available layouts you can select for editing. But
at the top of the page there is still the 'New layout' button.

Add New Layout
|image261|

-  The name you assign to the layout is for your benefit, name it
   something that will be easy to identify at a later date

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for your layout.

   Units of Measurement
   |image262|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72" an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  Next note if this layout is for the front or the back of the patron
   card

   -  **Note**

          You will need a layout for both the front and back of your
          card if you have 2-sided library cards, this option doesn't
          allow you to print two sided cards, just lets you track which
          side of the card you're designing.

-  You have the option of adding up to 3 lines of text to your card.
   Your text can be static text of your choosing and/or fields from the
   patron record. If you want to print fields from the patron record you
   want to put the field names in brackets like so - <firstname>

   -  **Note**

          A full list of field names can be found in the database schema
          at http://schema.koha-community.org

-  For each line of text, you can choose your font, font size and the
   location of the text on the card using the lower X and Y coordinates

-  In order to show the barcode and the patron card number you will need
   to check the 'Print Card Number as Barcode' option. This will turn
   the patron card number into a barcode. If you want the number to
   print in human readable format you will need to check the 'Print Card
   Number as Text Under Barcode' option.

-  Finally you can choose up to two images to print on the card.

   -  One can be the `patron image <#uploadpatronimages>`__ which you
      can resize to meet your needs.

   -  The other image can be something like a library logo or symbol
      that you uploaded using the '`Manage
      Images <#managecardimages>`__' module of the Patron Card Creator
      Tool.

    **Important**

    It is the designers responsibility to define textlines, barcode and
    images such that overlap is avoided.

After saving, your layouts will appear on the 'Manage layouts' page.

`Templates <#patrontemplate>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron Card Creator > Manage > Card
   templates

A template describes the arrangement of labels on the label sheet/card
stock you are using. This might be Avery 5160 for address labels,
Gaylord 47-284 for spine labels or Avery 28371 for your patron cards,
just to give a couple of examples. All of the information you will need
for setting up a template may be on the packaging, and if not it can
usually be found on the vendor's website or can be measured from a
sample sheet.

`Add a Template <#addcardtemplate>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new template click on the 'New template' button at the top of
your page which brings you to the Edit template form immediately. You
may also choose to press 'Manage templates' on the left side. Here you
are offered a list of available templates you can select for editing.
But in the top of the page there is still the 'New template' button.

New template button
|image264|

Using the form that appears after pressing either 'Edit' or 'New
template'you can define the template for your sheet of labels or cards.

Add Patron Card Template
|image265|

-  Template ID is simply a system generated unique id

-  Template Code should be the name of this template to identify it on a
   list of templates

-  You can use the Template Description to add additional information
   about the template

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for the template.

   Measurement Units
   |image266|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72" an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  The measurements (page height, page width, card width, card height)
   may be on the packaging, and if not it can usually be found on the
   vendor's website or can be measured from a sample sheet.

-  A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given template just
   prior to printing which compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar
   to a given printer (to which the profile is assigned).

   -  Before defining a profile try printing some sample cards so that
      you can take measurements to define a profile to perform the right
      adjustments for your printer/template combination.

   -  After finding and documenting any anomalies in the printed
      document, then you can `create a profile <#addcardprofile>`__ and
      assign it to the template.

   -  **Important**

          Do not specify a profile unless needed, i.e. do not click to
          define a printer profile. It is not possible to remove a
          profile from a template but you can switch to another profile.

   -  **Note**

          If you are using different printers you may be required to
          define several templates that are identical only different
          profiles are specified.

After saving, your templates will appear on the 'Manage templates' page.

Manage Templates

`Profiles <#patronprofile>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Patron Card Creator > Manage > Profiles

A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given
`template <#patrontemplate>`__ just prior to printing which compensates
for anomalies unique and peculiar to a given printer. This means if you
set a template up and then print a sample set of data and find that the
items are not all aligned the same on each card, you need to set up a
profile for each printer (or even different tray selections on the same
printer) to make up for the differences in printing styles, such as the
shifting of text to the left, right, top or bottom.

If your cards are printing just the way you want, you will not need a
profile.

`Add a Profile <#addcardprofile>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new profile, you want to click on the 'Profiles' button at the
top of your page and choose 'New Profile'

New Profile Button
|image268|

To add a new profile, you want to click on the 'New profile' button at
the top of your page. Using the form that appears you can define the
values to correct the card misalignments on your label sheet. You may
also choose 'Manage profiles' on the left side and select one of the
currently available profiles for editing.

Add Printer Profile
|image269|

-  The Printer Name and Paper Bin do not have to match your printer
   exactly, they are for your reference so you can remember what printer
   you have set the profile for.

   -  **Note**

          For example: if you want to use the Printer model number in
          printer name you can, or you can call it 'the printer on my
          desk'

-  Template will be filled in once you have chosen which template to
   apply the profile to on the `template edit form <#addcardtemplate>`__

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for your profile.

   Units of Measurement
   |image270|

   -  **Note**

          A Postscript Point is 1/72" an Adobe Agate is 1/64", an Inch
          is 25.4 SI Millimeters

-  Offset should be used when the entire image is off center either
   vertically or horizontally. Creep describes a condition where the
   distance between the labels changes across the page or up and down
   the page

   -  For offset and creep values, negative numbers move the printed
      information up and to the left on the printed sheet and positive
      numbers move down and to the right

   -  Example: the text is printed 0 .25" from the left edge of the
      first label, 0 .28" from the left edge of the second label and 0
      .31" from the left edge of the third label. This means the
      horizontal creep should be set to (minus) -0.03 " to make up for
      this difference.

After saving, your profiles will appear on the 'Manage Printer Profiles'
page.

`Rotating Collections <#rotatingcollections>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Rotating Collections

Rotating Collections is a tool for managing collections of materials
that frequently get shifted from library to library. It adds the ability
to store not only an item's home library and current location but also
information about where it is supposed to be transferred to next to
ensure that all items in the collection are sent to the correct library.
When an item in a rotating collection is checked in, library staff is
notified that the item is part of a rotating collection and which branch
it should be sent to if it is not at the correct one.

    **Important**

    The `AutomaticItemReturn <#AutomaticItemReturn>`__ system preference
    must be set to "Don't automatically transfer items to their home
    library when they are returned" for Rotating Collections to function
    properly.

-  To create a new rotating collection, click the "New Collection"
   button, fill in the Title and Description, and click Submit. Once
   submitted you'll see "Collection Name added successfully"; click
   "Return to rotating collections home" to return to the main Rotating
   Collections management page (or click Rotating Collections in the
   sidebar).

-  To add items to a collection, click "Add or remove items" next to the
   collection's name in the list of collections. Under "Add or remove
   items" scan or type in the barcode of the item you wish to add to the
   collection, and hit Enter or click Submit if necessary.

-  To remove an item from a collection, either click Remove next to the
   item's barcode in the list of items within the collection or check
   the "Remove item from collection" box next to the Barcode text box
   under "Add or remove items, and scan or type in the barcode, clicking
   Submit or hitting Enter if necessary. Note: The "Remove item from
   collection" checkbox will remain checked as long as you are on the
   "Add or remove items" page, unless you uncheck it, to facilitate
   quickly removing a number of items at a time by scanning their
   barcodes.

`Transfer a Rotating Collection <#transferrotatingcollection>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transferring a collection will:

-  Change the current location of the items in that collection to the
   library it is to be transferred to

-  Initiate a transfer from its original current location/holding
   library to the current location/holding library it is to be rotated
   to. When a library receives a collection they will need to check in
   the items to complete the transfer.

You can transfer a collection in one of two ways:

-  From the main Rotating Collections page, click on Transfer next to
   the title of the collection you wish to transfer; choose the library
   you wish to transfer the collection to and click "Transfer
   collection".

-  Or, from the "add or remove items" page for a collection, you can
   click the Transfer button, choose the library you wish to transfer
   the collection to and click "Transfer Collection".

    **Important**

    In order to complete the transfer process, the library receiving the
    rotating collection should check in all items from the collection as
    they receive them. This will clear the transfer so that the items
    are no longer shown as being "in transit".

If an item in a rotating collection is checked in at a library other
than the one it is supposed to be transferred to, a notification will
appear notifying library staff that the item is part of a rotating
collection, also letting them know where the item needs to be sent.

`Inventory/Stocktaking <#inventory>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Inventory/Stocktaking

Koha's Inventory Tool can be used in one of two ways, the first is by
printing out a shelf list that you can then mark items off on, or by
uploading a text files of barcodes gathered by a portable scanner.

If you do not have the ability to use your barcode scanner on the floor
of the library, the first option available to you is to generate a shelf
list based on criteria you enter.

Inventory & Stocktaking Tool
|image315|

Choose which library, shelving location, call number range, item status
and when the item was last seen to generate a shelf list that you can
then print to use while walking around the library checking your
collection

Shelf List
|image316|

Alternatively you can export the list to a CSV file for altering in an
application on your desktop. Simply check the box next to 'Export to csv
file' to generate this file.

Once you have found the items on your shelves you can return to this
list and check off the items you found to have the system update the
last seen date to today.

If you have a portable scanner (or a laptop and USB scanner) you can
walk through the library with the scanner in hand and scan barcodes as
you come across them. Once finished you can then upload the text file
generated by the scanner to Koha

Barcode Import for Inventory Tool
|image317|

Choose the text file and the date you want to mark all items as seen and
then scroll to the very bottom and click 'Submit.'

`Label Creator <#labelcreator>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Label Creator

The Label Creator allow you to use layouts and templates which you
design to print a nearly unlimited variety of labels including barcodes.
Here are some of the features of the Label Creator module:

-  Customize label layouts

-  Design custom label templates for printed labels

-  Build and manage batches of labels

-  Export single or multiple batches

-  Export single or multiple labels from within a batch

-  Export label data in one of three formats:

   -  PDF - Readable by any standard PDF reader, making labels printable
      directly on a printer

   -  CSV - Export label data after your chosen layout is applied
      allowing labels to be imported in to a variety of applications

   -  XML - Included as an alternate export format

`Templates <#labeltemplates>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Label Creator > Manage > Label templates

A template is based on the label/card stock you are using. This might be
Avery 5160 for address labels, Gaylord 47-284 for spine labels or Avery
28371 for your patron cards, just to give a couple of examples. These
labels will include all of the information you will need for setting up
a Koha, this information may be on the packaging, and if not it can
usually be found on the vendor's website.

`Add a Template <#addlabeltemplate>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new template, you want to click on the 'New' button at the top
of the Label Creator and choosing 'Label template'.

New Label Template Option
|image318|

Using the form that appears you can define the template for your sheet
of labels or cards.

Label Template Form
|image319|

-  Template ID will be automatically generated after saving your
   template, this is simply a system generated unique id

-  Template Code should be something you can use to identify your
   template on a list of templates

-  You can use the Template Description to add additional information
   about the template

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for the template. This should probably match the
   unit of measurement used on the template description provided by the
   product vendor.

   Measurement Units
   |image320|

-  The measurements, number of columns and number of rows can be found
   on the vendor product packaging or website.

   -  **Important**

          If you do not supply a left text margin in the template, a
          3/16" (13.5 point) left text margin will apply by default.

-  A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given template just
   prior to printing which compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar
   to a given printer (to which the profile is assigned).

   -  Before picking a profile try printing some sample labels so that
      you can easily define a profile that is right for your
      printer/template combination.

   -  After finding any anomalies in the printed document, `create a
      profile <#addlabelprofile>`__ and assign it to the template.

After saving, your templates will appear on the 'Manage' area under
'Label templates'.

List of label templates
|image321|

`Profiles <#labelprofiles>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Label Creator > Manage > Printer Profiles

A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given
`template <#addlabeltemplate>`__ just prior to printing which
compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar to a given printer (to
which the profile is assigned). This means if you set a template up and
then print a sample set of data and find that the items are not all
aligned the same on each label, you need to set up a profile for each
printer to make up for the differences in printing styles, such as the
shifting of text to the left, right, top or bottom.

If your labels are printing just the way you want, you will not need a
profile.

`Add a Profile <#addlabelprofile>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new profile, you want to click on the 'New' button at the top
of the Label Creator tool and choose 'Printer profile'.

New Profile Button
|image322|

Using the form that appears you can create a profile to fix any problems
with your template.

Create a Printer Profile
|image323|

-  The Printer Name and Paper Bin do not have to match your printer
   exactly, they are for your reference so you can remember what printer
   you have set the profile for. So if you want to use the Printer model
   number in printer name or you can call it 'the printer on my desk'

-  Template will be filled in once you have chosen which template to
   apply the profile to on the `template edit
   form <#addlabeltemplate>`__

-  The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're
   going to be using for your profile.

   Units of Measurement
   |image324|

-  Offset describes what happens when the entire image is off center
   either vertically or horizontally and creep describes a condition
   where the distance between the labels changes across the page or up
   and down the page

   -  For these values, negative numbers move the error up and to the
      left and positive numbers move the error down and to the right

   -  Example: the text is .25" from the left edge of the first label,
      .28" from the left edge of the second label and .31" from the left
      edge of the third label. This means the horizontal creep should be
      set to .03" to make up for this difference.

After saving, your profiles will appear on the 'Manage' area under
'Printer profiles'.

List of Profiles
|image325|

Once you have saved your new profile, you can return to the list of
templates and choose to edit the template that this profile is for.

`Layouts <#labellayouts>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Label Creator > Manage > Layouts

A layout is used to define the fields you want to appear on your labels.

`Add a Layout <#addlabellayout>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To add a new layout, you want to click on the 'New' button at the top of
the Label Creator tool and choose 'Layout'.

New Layout Button
|image326|

Using the form that appears you can create a profile to fix any problems
with your template.

Add New Layout
|image327|

-  The name of your layout can be anything you'd like to help you
   identify it later.

-  If this is a barcode label you'll want to choose the encoding (Code
   39 is the most common)

-  The layout type can be any combination of bibliographic information
   and/or barcode. For example a spine label would just be Biblio
   whereas a label for your circulation staff to use to checkout the
   book would probably be Biblio/Barcode.

-  The Bibliographic Data to Print includes any of the data fields that
   may be mapped to your MARC frameworks. You can choose from the preset
   list of fields or you can click on 'List Fields' and enter your own
   data. In 'List Fields', you can specify MARC subfields as a
   4-character tag-subfield string: (ie. 254a for the title field), You
   can also enclose a whitespace-separated list of fields to concatenate
   on one line in double quotes. (ie. "099a 099b" or "itemcallnumber
   barcode"). The fields available are from the database tables list
   below. Finally you could add in static text strings in single-quote
   (ie. 'Some static text here.')

   -  You can use the schema viewer (http://schema.koha-community.org)
      with the following tables to find field names to use:

      -  Currently all fields in the following tables are used: items,
         biblioitems, biblio, branches

         List fields
         |image328|

-  Choose if the label maker should print out the guidelines around each
   label

-  Choose if you'd like Koha to try to split your call numbers (usually
   used on Spine Labels)

-  Finally choose your text settings such as alignment, font type and
   size.

After saving, your layouts will appear on the 'Manage Layouts' page.

`Batches <#labelbatches>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Label Creator > Manage > Label batches

Batches are made up of the barcodes you would like to print. Once in
this tool you can search for the item records you would like to print
out labels for.

`Add a Batch <#addlabelbatch>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Batches can be created in one of two ways. The first is to click the
'Create Label Batch' link on the '`Staged MARC
Management <#managestaged>`__' page:

Create Label Batch Link on Staged Records List
|image329|

The other is to choose to create a new batch from the label creator tool

Create New Batch
|image330|

You will be brought to an empty batch with a box to scan barcodes or
itemnumbers in to and an 'Add item(s)' button at the bottom of the page.

Add Items
|image331|

You can either scan barcodes in to the box provided and click the 'Add
item(s)' button or you can click the 'Add item(s)' button with the
barcodes box empty. Clicking 'Add item(s)' with nothing in the barcodes
box will open a search window for you to find the items you want to add
to the batch.

Search for items for a Batch
|image332|

From the search results, click the check box next to the items you want
to add to the batch and click the 'Add checked' button. You can also add
items one by one by clicking the 'Add' link to the left of each item.

Batch search results
|image333|

Once you have added all of the items click the 'Done' button. The
resulting page will list the items you have selected.

List of items in the batch
|image334|

To print your labels, click the 'Export full batch' button. To print
only some of the labels, click the 'Export selected item(s)' button.
Either way you will be presented with a confirmation screen where you
can choose your template and layout.

Start batch export
|image335|

You will then be presented with three download options: PDF, Excel, and
CSV.

After saving your file, simply print to the blank labels you have in
your library.

`Quick Spine Label Creator <#quicklabelcreator>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Quick Spine Label Creator

    **Note**

    This tool does not use the label layouts or templates, it simply
    prints a spine label in the first spot on the label sheet.

    -  Define the fields you want to print on the spine label in the
       `SpineLabelFormat <#SpineLabelFormat>`__ system preference

    -  Format your label printing by editing spinelabel.css found in
       koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/css/

To use this tool you simply need the barcode for the book you'd like to
print the spine label for.

`MARC modification templates <#marcmodtemplates>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MARC Modification Templates system gives Koha users the power to
make alterations to MARC records automatically while staging MARC
records for import.

This tool is useful for altering MARC records from various
venders/sources work with your MARC framework. The system essentially
allows one to create a basic script using actions to Copy, Move, Add,
Update and Delete fields.

Start by adding a new template (a template can be made up of one or more
actions) by entering a name and clicking 'Create template'.

Add a new template
|image338|

Next you can add actions to the template by filling in the Action box.
For example if you're loading in a batch of files from your EBook vendor
you might want to add the biblio item type of EBOOK to the 942$c.Add
action

-  Choose 'Add/Update'

-  Enter the field 942 and subfield c

-  Enter the value of 'EBOOK' (or whatever your ebook item type code is)

-  Provide a description so you can identify this action later

-  Click 'Add action'

Each action can also have an optional condition to check the value or
existance of another field. For example you might want to add the call
number to the item record if it's not already there.

Add conditional action
|image339|

-  Choose 'Copy'

-  Decide if you want to copy the first occurance or all occurances of
   the field

-  Enter the field 090 (or other biblio call number field) and subfield
   a to copy

-  Enter the 952 field and o subfield to copy to

-  Choose 'if'

-  Enter the 952 field and o subfield

-  Choose "doesn't exist"

-  Provide a description so you can identify this action later

-  Click 'Add action'

The Copy & Move actions also support Regular Expressions, which can be
used to automatically modify field values during the copy/move. An
example would be to strip out the '$' character in field 020$c.

Add regex action
|image340|

-  Choose 'Copy and replace'

-  Decide if you want to copy the first occurance or all occurances of
   the field

-  Enter the field 020 and subfield c to copy

-  Enter the 020 field and c subfield to copy to

-  Check the 'RegEx' box and enter your regular expression (in this case
   s/\\$// )

-  Choose 'if'

-  Enter the 020 field and c subfield

-  Choose "matches"

-  Check the 'RegEx' box and enter your regular expression (in this case
   m/^\\$/ )

-  Provide a description so you can identify this action later

-  Click 'Add action'

    **Note**

    The value for an update can include variables that change each time
    the template is used. Currently, the system supports two variables,
    \_\_BRANCHCODE\_\_ which is replaced with the branchcode of the
    library currently using the template, and \_\_CURRENTDATE\_\_ which
    is replaced with the current date in ISO format ( YYYY-MM-DD ).

You could also use regular expressions to add your library's proxy URL
in front of links in your MARC record.Add proxy URL

-  Choose 'Copy and replace'

-  Decide if you want to copy the first occurance or all occurances of
   the field

-  Enter the field 856 and subfield u to copy

-  Enter the 856 field and u subfield to copy to

-  Check the 'RegEx' box and enter your regular expression (in this case
   s/^/PROXY\_URL/ )

-  Provide a description so you can identify this action later

-  Click 'Add action'

When choosing between 'Copy' and 'Copy and replace' keep the following
example in mind:

::

    245 _aThe art of computer programming _cDonald E. Knuth. 
    300 _aA_exists _bB_exists 

If we apply action (a) Copy the whole field 245 to 300, we get:

::

    245 _aThe art of computer programming _cDonald E. Knuth. 
    300 _aA_exists _bB_exists 
    300 _aThe art of computer programming _cDonald E. Knuth. 

If we apply action (b) Copy the subfield 245$a to 300$a, we get:

::

    245 _aThe art of computer programming _cDonald E. Knuth. 
    300 _aThe art of computer programming _bB_exists

Once your actions are saved you can view them at the top of the screen.
Actions can be moved around using the arrows to the left of them.

View actions
|image341|

Depending on your actions the order may be very important. For example
you don't want to delete a field before you copy it to another field.

To add another template you can either start fresh or click the
'Duplicate current template' checkbox to create a copy of an existing
template to start with.

Duplicate template
|image342|

Once your template is saved you will be able to pick it when using the
`Stage MARC Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__ tool.

Choose template

`Stage MARC Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Stage MARC records for import

This tool can be used to import both bibliographic and authority records
that are saved in MARC format. Importing records into Koha includes two
steps. The first is to stage records for import.

-  First find the MARC file on your computer

   Stage MARC Records for Import
   |image344|

-  Next you will be presented with options for record matching and item
   imports

   Upload options
   |image345|

   -  Enter 'Comments about this file' to identify your upload when
      going to the '`Manage Staged MARC Records <#managestaged>`__' tool

   -  Tell Koha which type of file this is, bibliographic or authority

      Record type
      |image346|

   -  Choose the character encoding

      Chracter encoding
      |image347|

   -  Choose if you would like to use a `MARC Modification
      Template <#marcmodtemplates>`__ to alter the data you're about to
      import

      Choose modification template
      |image348|

   -  Choose whether or not you want to look for matching records

      Look for matches
      |image349|

      -  You can set up `record matching rules <#recordmatchingrules>`__
         through the administration area

         Matching rules
         |image350|

         -  When using the ISBN matching rule Koha will find only exact
            matches. If you find that the ISBN match is not working to
            your satisfaction you can change the
            `AggressiveMatchOnISBN <#AggressiveMatchOnISBN>`__
            preference to 'Do' and then run your import again.

   -  Next choose what to do with matching records if they are found

   -  Finally choose what to do with records that are unique

   -  Next you can choose whether or not to import the item data found
      in the MARC records (if the file you're loading is a bibliographic
      file)

      Import items
      |image351|

      -  From here you can choose to always add items regardless of
         matching status, add them only if a matching bib was found, add
         items only if there was no matching bib record, replace items
         if a matching bib was found (The match will look at the
         itemnumbers and barcodes to match on for items. Itemnumbers
         take precendence over barcodes), or Ignore items and not add
         them.

-  Click 'Stage for import'

-  You will be presented with a confirmation of your MARC import

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Catalog > Upload Local Cover Image

This tool will allow you to upload cover images for the materials in
your catalog. To access this tool, staff will need the
`upload\_local\_cover\_images permission <#toolspermissions>`__. In
order for images to show in the staff client and/or OPAC you will need
to set your `LocalCoverImages <#LocalCoverImages>`__ and/or
`OPACLocalCoverImages <#OPACLocalCoverImages>`__ preferences to
'Display.' Images can be uploaded in batches or one by one.

    **Note**

    Koha does not have a maximum file size limit for this tool, but
    Apache may limit the maximum size of uploads (talk to your sys
    admin).

    **Note**

    When you want to upload multiple images onto a bib record, they will
    display left to right (then top to bottom, depending on screen real
    estate) in order of uploading, and the one on the left (the first
    one uploaded) will be the one used as a thumbnail cover in search
    results and on the detail page. There is no way to reorder cover
    images uploaded in this way, so be sure to upload them in the order
    you'd like them to appear.Multiple cover images on one record

If uploading a single image:

-  Visit the tool and click the 'Browse' button to browse to the image
   on your local machine.

apply the event to one branch or all branches. To add events, simply

-  Click on the date on the calendar that you would like to apply the
   closing to

   Calendar Add Form
   |image370|

-  In the form that appears above the calendar, enter the closing
   information (for more info on each option click the question mark [?]
   to the right of the option)

   -  Library will be filled in automatically based on the library you
      chose from the pull down at the top of the page

   -  The day information will also be filled in automatically based on
      the date you clicked on the calendar

   -  In the description enter the reason the library is closed

   -  Next you can choose if this event is a one time event or if it is
      repeatable.

      -  If this is a one day holiday choose 'Holiday only on this day'

      -  If this is a weekly closing (like a weekend day) then you can
         choose 'Holiday repeated every same day of the week'

      -  If this is an annual holiday closing choose 'Holiday repeated
         yearly on the same date'

      -  If the library is going to be closed for the week or a range of
         time choose 'Holiday on a range' and enter a 'To Date' at the
         top

      -  If the library is going to be closed for a range of time each
         year (such as summer holidays for schools) choose 'Holiday
         repeated yearly on a range' and enter a 'To Date' at the top

   -  Finally decide if this event should be applied to all libraries or
      just the one you have originally selected

      -  If you'd rather enter all the holidays and then copy them all
         to another branch all at once you can use the copy menu below
         the calendar

         Copy holidays
         |image371|

   Edit holiday form
   |image373|

-  From this form you can make edits to the holiday or delete the
   holiday completely.

   -  All actions require that you click 'Save' before the change will

`CSV Profiles <#csvprofiles>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Get there:* More > Tools > Additional Tools > CSV Profiles

CSV Profiles are created to define how you would like your cart or list
to export.

`Add CSV Profiles <#addcsvprofile>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a CSV Profile

-  Click 'CSV Profiles' from the Tools menu

-  The 'Profile type' determines what type of fields you plan to use
   (MARC or SQL) to define your profile

   -  If you choose MARC then you will need to enter MARC fields

   MARC CSV Profile
   |image376|

   -  If you choose SQL then you will need to enter SQL database fields

      SQL CSV Profile
      |image377|

   -  The 'Profile name' will appear on the export pull down list when
      choosing 'Download' from your cart or list

      Download List
      |image378|

   -  The 'Profile description' is for your own benefit, but will also
      appear in the OPAC when patrons download content, so make sure
      it's clear to your patrons as well

   -  The 'CSV separator' is the character used to separate values and
      value groups

          **Note**

          The most common option here is comma because most spreadsheet
          applications know how to open files split by commas.

   -  The 'Field separator' is the character used to separate duplicate
      fields

      -  Example: You may have multiple 650 fields and this is the
         character that will appear in between each one in the column

         Field separators in between multiple subjects
         |image379|

   -  The 'Subfield separator' is the character used to separate
      duplicate subfields

      -  Example: You may have multiple $a subfields in a field

   -  The 'Encoding' field lets you define the encoding used when saving
      the file

   -  Finally format your CSV file using the 'Profile MARC' or 'Profile
      SQL' field

      -  Define which fields or subfields you want to export, separated
         by pipes. Example : 200\|210$a\|301 for MARC and
         biblio.title\|biblio.author for SQL

      -  **Note**

             You can also use your own headers (instead of the ones from
             Koha) by prefixing the field number with an header,
             followed by the equal sign. Example : Personal
             name=100\|title=245$a\|300

   When you have entered in all of the information for you profile,
   simply click 'Submit' and you will be presented with a confirmation
   that your profile has been saved.

-  First enter the identifying information regarding your patron

   Add Patron Form
   |image408|

   -  Required fields are defined in the
      `BorrowerMandatoryField <#BorrowerMandatoryField>`__ system
      preference

   -  Salutation is populated by the
      `BorrowersTitles <#BorrowersTitles>`__ system preference

   -  **Note**

          If you'd like to prevent full names from printing on
          `slips <#notices>`__ and you're not using the Initials or
          Other name fields for anything else, you can use them for
          shortened versions of the name to then be printed on the slip.

          For example:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole C.
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: NCE

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>> instead of the full name (NCE).

          Or you could do something like this:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: E

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>>, <<borrowers.firstname>> instead of the
          full name (E, Nicole).

-  Next enter the contact information

   Patron Contact Information
   |image409|

   -  For contact information, note that the primary phone and email
      addresses are the ones that appear on notices and slips printed
      during circulation (receipts, transfer slips and hold slips). The
      primary email is also the one that overdue notices and other
      messages go to.

-  If this patron is a child, you will be asked to attach the child
   patron to an adult patron

   Guarantor Linking
   |image410|

   -  Click 'Set to Patron' to search your system for an existing patron

   -  If the Guarantor is not in the system, you can enter the first and

   the library

   Library Management
   |image413|

   -  The card number field is automatically calculated if you have the
      `autoMemberNum <#autoMemberNum>`__ system preference set that way

      -  **Note**

             For a newly installed system this preference will start at
             1 and increment by 1 each time after. To have it start with
             the starting number of your barcodes, enter the first
             barcode by hand in the patron record and save the patron.
             After that the field will increment that number by 1.

   -  If you accidentally chose the wrong patron category at the
      beginning you can fix that here

   -  Sort 1 and 2 are used for statistical purposes within your library

-  Next, the Library Setup section includes additional library settings

   Library set-up options
   |image414|

   -  The registration date will automatically be filled in with today's
      date

   -  If your patron cards expire (based on your `patron category
      settings <#patcats>`__) the Expiry date will automatically be
      calculated

   -  The OPAC Note is a note for the patron - it will appear in the
      OPAC on the patron's record

   -  The Circulation Note is meant solely for your library staff and
      will appear when the circulation staff goes to check an item out
      to the patron

      Sample Circulation Note

   -  The Staff/OPAC asks for the username and password to be used by
      the patron (and/or staff member) to log into their account in the
      OPAC and for staff to log in to the staff client.

      -  Staff will only be able to use this log in info to log in to
         the staff client if they have the `necessary
         permissions <#patronpermissions>`__.

-  If you have set `additional patron
   attributes <#patronattributetypes>`__ up, these will appear next

   Additional Patron Attributes
   |image416|

-  Finally, if you have
   `EnhancedMessagingPreferences <#EnhancedMessagingPreferences>`__ set
   to 'allow,' you can choose the messaging preferences for this patron.

   Patron Messaging Settings
   |image417|

   -  These notices are:

      -  Advanced notice : A notice in advance of the patron's items
         being due (The patron can choose the number of days in advance)

      -  Item checkout : A notice that lists all the of the items the
         patron has just checked out and/or renewed, this is an
         electronic form of the checkout receipt

      -  Hold filled : A notice when you have confirmed the hold is
         waiting for the patron

      -  Item due : A notice on the day and item is due back at the
         library

      -  Item check-in : A notice that lists all the of the items the
         patron has just checked in

   -  Patrons can choose to receive their notices as a digest by
      checking the 'Digest only?' box along with the delivery method. A
      digest is a combination of all the messages of that type (so all
      items due in 3 days in one email) in to one email instead of
      multiple emails for each alert.

   -  **Important**

          These preferences will override any you set via the `patron
          categories <#addingpatroncat>`__

   -  **Important**

          These preference can be altered by the patron via the OPAC

-  Once finished, click 'Save'

If the system suspects this patron is a duplicate of another it will
warn you.

Patron Duplicate Suspected
|image418|

    **Note**

    A duplicate patron is detected if first and last names match and
    there is no date of birth populated or if first name, last name and
    date of birth fields are all populated. If two patrons have matching
    names, but one has a date of birth and the other does not they will
    not match as duplicates.

If you have set a minimum or upper age limit on the patron category and
are requiring that the birth date be filled in, Koha will warn you if
the patron you're adding is too old or young for the patron category you
have selected:

`Add a Staff Patron <#addstaffpatron>`__
----------------------------------------

All staff members must be entered into Koha as patrons of the 'Staff'
type. Follow the steps in `Add a Patron <#addnewpatron>`__ to add a
staff member. To give the staff member permissions to access the staff
client, follow the steps in `Patron Permissions <#patronpermissions>`__

    **Important**

    Remember to assign your staff secure usernames and passwords since
    these will be used to log into the staff client.

`Add a Statistical Patron <#addstatspatron>`__
----------------------------------------------

One way to track use of in house items is to "check out" the materials
to a statistical patron. The "check out" process doesn’t check the book
out, but instead tracks an in house use of the item. To use this method
for tracking in house use you first will need a `patron
category <#patcats>`__ set up for your Statistical patron.

In House Patron Category
|image420|

Next, you will need to create a new patron of the statistical type

New In House Patron
|image421|

Next, follow the steps put forth in the '`Add a new
Patron <#addnewpatron>`__' section of this manual. Since this patron is
not a real person, simply fill in the required fields, the correct
library and nothing else.

To learn about other methods of tracking in house use visit the
`Tracking inhouse use <#trackinhouse>`__ section of this manual.

`Duplicate a Patron <#duplicatepatron>`__
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes when you're adding a new family to your system you don't want
to type the contact information over and over. Koha allows for you to
duplicate a patron and change only the parts you want to (or need to)
change.

-  Open the patron you want to use as your base (the patron you want to
   duplicate information from)

-  Click the 'Duplicate' button at the top of their record

   The Duplicate Button is the 3rd one in
   |image422|

-  All of the fields with the exception of first name, card number,
   username and password have been duplicated. Fill in the missing
   pieces and click 'Save'

   Duplicating Patron Form
   |image423|

   -  **Note**

          Clicking in a field that is already populated with data will
          clear that field of all information (making it easier for you
          to type in something different)

-  You will be brought to your new patron

   Newly created patron
   |image424|

`Add Patron Images <#addpatronimages>`__
----------------------------------------

If you would like you can add patron images to help identify patrons. To
enable this feature you must first set the
`patronimages <#patronimages>`__ preference to 'Allow'.

If the preference is set to 'Allow' you will see a placeholder image
under the patron's name and box to upload a patron image below the basic
contact information.

Add patron image
|image425|

In the 'Upload Patron Image' box click 'Browse' to find the image on
your computer and 'Upload' to load the image on to the patron record.

|image426|

    **Important**

    There is a limit of 100K on the size of the picture uploaded and it
    is recommended that the image be 200x300 pixels, but smaller images
    will work as well.

`Editing Patrons <#editpatrons>`__

-  Patron passwords are not recoverable. The stars show on the patron
   detail next to the Password label are always there even if a password
   isn't set. If a patron forgets their password the only option is to
   reset their password. To change the patron's password, click the
   'Change Password' button

   Patron Password Change Form
   |image428|

   -  Koha cannot display existing passwords. Leave the field blank to

      click the link labeled "Click to fill with a randomly generated
      suggestion. Passwords will be displayed as text."

-  To edit a specific section of the patron record (for example the
   Library Use section) click the 'Edit' link below the section

   Library Use Section of Patron Record
   |image429|

-  A patron image can be added by browsing for the image on your machine
   from the 'Manage Patron Image' section

   Manage Patron Image Form
   |image430|

   -  This form will not appear if you have the
      `patronimages <#patronimages>`__ system preference to not allow
      patron images

   -  To add patron images in bulk, use the `Upload Patron
      Images <#uploadpatronimages>`__ Tool

-  Patrons can also be blocked from checking items out by setting Patron
   Flags

   Patron Warning Flags
   |image431|

   -  If you would like your circulation staff to confirm a patron's
      address before checking items out to the patron, you can see the
      'Gone no Address' flag

      Patron's address in doubt
      |image432|

   -  If the patron reports that they have lost their card you can set
      the 'Lost Card' flag to prevent someone else from using that card
      to check items out

      Patron lost card
      |image433|

   -  If you would like to bar a patron from the library you can add a
      manual restriction

      Add manual restriction
      |image434|

      -  **Note**

             This flag can automatically be set with the `Overdue/Notice
             Status Triggers <#noticetriggers>`__

   -  If you enter in a date and/or note related to the restriction you
      will see that in the restricted message as well

      Restricted until message
      |image435|

-  Children patrons do not become adults automatically in Koha unless
   you have `Juvenile to Adult cron job <#j2acron>`__ running. To
   upgrade a child patron to and adult patron category manually go to
   the 'More' menu and choose 'Update Child to Adult Patron'

   Update Child to Adult Patron
   |image436|

   -  You will then be presented with a pop up window asking which one
      of your adult patron categories this Child should be updated to

      Choose Adult Category to Update To
      |image437|

`Managing Patron Self Edits <#mangepatronedits>`__
--------------------------------------------------

If you are allowing patrons to edit their accounts via the OPAC with the
`OPACPatronDetails <#OPACPatronDetails>`__ preference then you will need
to approve all changes via the staff client before they're applied. If
there are patron edits awaiting action they will appear on the staff
client dashboard below the modules list (along with other items awaiting
action).

Patron requests waiting
|image438|

    **Note**

    Superlibrarians will see modifications for any branch, other staff
    will only see modifications for patrons who belong to their logged

At the top of the Check Out screen is a box for you to type or scan the
item's barcode into.

-  **Important**

       Many modern barcode scanners will send a 'return' to the browser,
       making it so that the 'Check Out' button is automatically clicked

-  If the barcode is not found you will be prompted to use fast
   cataloging to add the item. Learn more about `fast
   cataloging <#fastaddcat>`__ later in this manual.

-  If you have
   `itemBarcodeFallbackSearch <#itemBarcodeFallbackSearch>`__ set to
   'Enable' then you can enter a keyword search in this box instead of
   just a barcode (this will make it possible to check out using title
   and/or call number).

To see more checkout options click the 'Checkout settings' link to
expand the checkout area.Checkout settings

Below the box for the barcode there may be options for you to override
the default due date for the item.

-  This option will only appear if you have set the
   `SpecifyDueDate <#SpecifyDueDate>`__ system preference to allow staff
   to override the due date

Below the box for the barcode you will see a checkbox for 'Automatic
renewal'. This will allow this item to automatically renew if the
`appropriate cron job <#autorenewcron>`__ is running and there are no
holds on the item.

Next is an option to no decrease the loan length based on holds. This
overrides the `decreaseLoanHighHolds <#decreaseLoanHighHolds>`__
preference.

If you're allowing the `checkout of items on site <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__
to patrons (these are usually items that are not for loan that you would
like to check for in library use) then you will see the 'On-site
checkout' checkbox after clicking the 'Checkout settings' link to expand
your circulation options.On-site checkout

At the bottom of the page there is a summary of the patron's current
checked out items along with the due date (and time if the item is an
hourly loan), items checked out today will appear at the top.

    **Note**

    Items that are hourly loan items will include the time with the due
    date.

`Printing Receipts <#printcircreceipt>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have checked out all of the items for the patron you can print
them a receipt by choosing one of two methods.

If you have the `CircAutoPrintQuickSlip <#CircAutoPrintQuickSlip>`__
preference set to 'open a print quick slip window' you can simply hit
enter on your keyboard or scan a blank piece of paper with your barcode
scanner. The idea being that you're "checking out" a blank barcode which
triggers Koha to print the 'Quick slip.'

You can also click the Print button at the top of the screen and choose
'Print slip' or 'Print quick slip'.

Print receipt to slip printer
|image494|

If you choose 'Print slip' it will print all of the items the patron has
checked out, including those they checked out at an earlier date.
Choosing 'Print quick slip' will print only the items that were checked
out today.

'Print summary' will generate a full page summary for the patron's
circulation information and 'Print overdues' will print out a slip that
lists all items that are overdue.

What prints on the slips can be customized by altering the slip
templates under the `Notices & Slips <#notices>`__ tool.

`Clear Patron Information <#clearpatroninfo>`__

and start over.

Clear Screen Button

If you have the `CircAutoPrintQuickSlip <#CircAutoPrintQuickSlip>`__
preference set to 'clear the screen' then you simply need to hit enter
or scan a blank barcode and the screen will be cleared of the current
patron.

`Batch Checkouts <#batchcheckout>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to perform a batch check out you can do so by turning
on the `BatchCheckouts <#BatchCheckouts>`__ system preference and
assigning the proper patron categories via the
`BatchCheckoutsValidCategories <#BatchCheckoutsValidCategories>`__
preference. This will allow you to use an RFID pad that reads multiple
barcodes or perform a batch check out for training internal use.Batch
checkouts

From this screen you can scan several barcodes or load a file of
barcodes. If those items cannot be checked out they will provide a
warning on the following screen

|image496|

If you are using a statistical patron type then you'll see that local
use was recorded for each item you scanned.

|image497|

`Check Out Messages <#checkoutmsg>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you check out an item that has multiple pieces and you have cataloged
that information in subfield 3 of the item record (in MARC21) a message
will pop up when you check out that item telling you how many pieces
should be there.

`Renewing <#circrenew>`__
-------------------------

Checked out items can be renewed (checked out for another period of
time) based on your `circulation rules <#circfinerules>`__ and `renewal
preferences <#RenewalPeriodBase>`__.

If `you allow it <#OpacRenewalAllowed>`__, patrons can renew their own
items via the OPAC, but sometimes you'll need to help them by renewing
their items via the staff client.

To renew items checked out to a patron, you can do one of two things.

The first is to visit their details page or checkout page and review
their checkout summary at the bottom.

Circulation Summary
|image518|

In the Renew column you will see how many times each item has been
renewed and a checkbox to renew the item for the patron. Check the boxed
of the items you would like to renew and click the 'Renew or Return
checked items' button, or to renew all items checked out to the patron
simply click the 'Renew all' button.

Renew buttons
|image519|

Sometimes renewals will be blocked based on your circulation rules, to
override this block you must have your
`AllowRenewalLimitOverride <#AllowRenewalLimitOverride>`__ preference
set to 'Allow'. If you allow renewal limit overrides, you will see a
checkbox at the bottom left of the circulation summary. Check that box
and then choose the items you would like to renew.

|image530|

If you are checking items in that were put in the book drop while the
library was closed you can check the 'Book drop mode' box before
scanning items. This will effectively roll back the returned date to the
last date the library was open.

-  This requires that you have your closings added to the `Holidays &
   Calendar Tool <#calholidays>`__

You can also choose to forgive all overdue charges for items you are
checking in by checking the 'Forgive overdue charges' box before
scanning items.

If you have the `SpecifyReturnDate <#SpecifyReturnDate>`__ preference
set to 'Allow' you will be able to arbitrarily set the return date from
below the check in box.Specify check in date

`Check In Messages <#checkinmsg>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several messages that can appear when checking items in:

-  If you are checking an item in at a library other than the home
   branch, a message will appear asking you to transfer the book to the
   home library

   Check in Transfer Message
   |image531|

   -  After this item is checked in the status of the item will be
      changed in the catalog to 'in transit'

      In Transit Status
      |image532|

   -  To mark an item as back at the home branch, check the item in at
      the home branch

      Check In Transferred Item
      |image533|

      -  A message will appear tell you that the item is not checked
         out, but the status will now say available in the catalog. This
         step is necessary to mark items as received by the home branch.

-  If you are checking in an item that should have multiple parts or
   pieces a message will appear warning you about the number of pieces
   you should have in your hand

   Materials Specified
   |image534|

-  If you're checking an item in that has a hold on it, you will be
   prompted to confirm the hold

   Hold Found Check In Message
   |image535|

   -  Clicking the Confirm hold button will mark the item as waiting for
      pickup from the library

      Hold waiting at the library
      |image536|

   -  Clicking the Print Slip and Confirm button will mark the item as
      waiting for pickup at the library and present the library with a
      receipt to print and place on the book with the patron's
      information

   -  Ignoring the hold will leave the item on hold, but leave its
      status as Available (it will not cancel the hold)

-  If you're checking in an item that has a hold on it at another branch
   you will be prompted to confirm and transfer the item

   Hold found for another branch
   |image537|

   -  Clicking the Confirm hold and Transfer button will mark the item
      as in transit to the library where the hold was placed

      In transit hold status
      |image538|

   -  Clicking the Print Slip, Transfer and Confirm button will mark the
      item as in transit to the library where the hold was placed and
      present the library with a receipt to print and place on the book
      with the patron's information

   -  Ignoring the hold will leave the item on hold, but leave its
      status as Available (it will not cancel the hold)

-  If you have the system showing you fines at the time of checkin
   (`FineNotifyAtCheckin <#FineNotifyAtCheckin>`__) you will see a
   message telling you about the fine and providing you a link to the
   payment page for that patron

   FineNotifyAtCheckin
   |image539|

`Circulation Messages <#circmessages>`__
----------------------------------------

Circulation messages are short messages that librarians can leave for
their patrons or their colleagues that will appear at the time of
circulation.

`Setting up Messages <#setcircmsg>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Circulation messages are set up as `Authorized
Values <#authorizedvalues>`__. To add or edit Circulation Messages you
want to work with the `BOR\_NOTES <#bornotes>`__ value.

BOR\_NOTES Authorized Values
|image540|

The 'Description' field can hold a canned message that you would like to
appear on the patron's record.

    **Important**

    The 'Description' field is limited to 80 characters, but the patron
    message field can hold more than that. Enter 80 characters in the
    'Description' field and then type the rest on the patron record.

`Adding a Message <#addcircmsg>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When on the patron's check out tab you will see a link to 'Add a new
message' to the right of the check out box and a button at the top to
'Add message'.

Circulation Message in Staff Client
|image541|

When you click either of these options you will be asked to choose if
the message is for the librarians or the patron and the message you
would like to leave.

Leave a Circulation Message
|image542|

    **Note**

    A message for the patron will also show to the library staff.

`Viewing Messages <#viewcircmsg>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Circulation messages meant for the staff and/or the patron will appear
on the patron's checkout screen to the right of the checkout box.
Messages in bold and red are meant for the library staff only, whereas
messages in regular italics font are meant for the patron and the
librarian.

Circulation Message in Staff Client
|image543|

Circulation messages meant for the patron will also appear when they log
into the OPAC.

|image544|

`Holds <#holds>`__
------------------

Koha allows patrons to put things on hold. A 'Hold' is a way to reserve
an item. Depending on your `circulation and fine
rules <#circfinerules>`__ and `hold preference <#circholdspolicy>`__
settings patrons will be able to place items on hold for pickup at the
library at a later date/time.

`Placing Holds in Staff Client <#holdsinstaff>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to place holds from the staff client. The most
obvious is using the 'Place Hold' button at the top of any bibliographic
record.

Place Hold Button on Bib Record
|image545|

You can also click the smaller 'Place Hold' link found at the top of
your catalog search results, or the 'Holds' link found below each
result.

Hold options on search results
|image546|

You will be asked to search for a patron by barcode or any part of their
name to start the hold process.

Find Patron For Hold
|image547|

If you'd like to search for the patron first and then the bib record for
the hold, you can open the patron record and click on the 'Search to
Hold' button at the top of the patron record.

Search to Hold on Patron Record
|image548|

After clicking the button you will be brought to the catalog search page
where you can find the book(s) you want to place a hold on. Under each
title on the results you'll see an option to 'Hold for Patron Name.'

Hold for Patron links on Search Results
|image549|

If you want to place a hold on multiple items, simply check the boxes to
the left of them and click the arrow to the right of the 'Place Hold'
button.

Hold Multiple Items for Patron
|image550|

Depending on how many items you choose to place a hold on at once you
will see a different place hold form. If you are placing a hold on one
bibliographic record you will see a list of all of the items you can
place a hold on.

Place Hold Form
|image551|

-  Enter any notes that might apply to this hold

-  Choose the library where the patron will pick up the item

-  If you have the
   `AllowHoldItemTypeSelection <#AllowHoldItemTypeSelection>`__
   preference set to 'Allow' and the record had more than one item type
   attached you will see an option to choose to limit the hold to a
   specific item typeAllowHoldItemTypeSelection

-  If the patron wants the hold to start on a date other than today,
   enter that in the 'Hold starts on date' field

   -  This option will only appear if the
      `AllowHoldDateInFuture <#AllowHoldDateInFuture>`__ system
      preference is set to 'Allow'

-  If the patron has specified that they don't want the item after a
   certain date, or if you have limits on hold lengths, you can enter an
   expiration date for the hold in the 'Hold expires on date'

   -  To have expired holds canceled automatically you will need to have
      the `Expired Holds <#expiredholdscron>`__ cron job set to run on a
      regular basis.

-  Next choose if you want to place a hold on the next available item or
   a specific item by clicking the radio button next to an individual
   item.

If you're placing a hold on multiple items you will be presented with
the next available option for all titles. If no items are available for
hold it will say so on the confirmation screen.

Place multiple items on hold
|image552|

Once your hold is placed, if you'd like to have Koha forget that you
used the 'Search to Hold' function, you can choose to have Koha 'forget'
the patron's name by clicking the arrow to the right of the 'Place Hold'
button on the search results and choosing the 'Forget' option.

Forget Search to Hold Option
|image553|

`Managing Holds <#manageholds>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Holds can be altered and canceled from the Holds tab found on the left
of the bibliographic record.

Bibliographic Record Tabs
|image554|

From the list of holds you can change the order of the holds, the pickup
location, suspend and/or cancel the hold.

Lists of Holds
|image555|

    **Note**

    If you have your
    `AutoResumeSuspendedHolds <#AutoResumeSuspendedHolds>`__ preference
    set to "Don't allow" then you will not have the option to put an end
    date on the hold suspension

    **Note**

    Depending on how you have your `HidePatronName <#HidePatronName>`__
    system preference set the list may show card numbers instead of
    names in the Patron column like in the image above.

To rearrange or delete holds, simply make a selection from the
'Priority' pull down or click the arrows to the right of the priority
pull down.

Hold Priority Menu
|image556|

If you use the priority pull down to rearrange or delete holds you will
need to click the 'Update hold(s)' button to save your changes.

Clicking the down arrow to the right of the hold will stick the hold at
the bottom of the list even if more requests are made.

For example, your library has home-bound patrons that are allowed to
keep books out for months at a time. It would not be fair to other
patrons if a home-bound patron were able to check out a brand new book
and keep it for months. For this reason, the home-bound patron's hold
request would stay at the bottom of the queue until everyone else who
wanted to read that book has already done so.

Lowest Priority & Delete Options for Holds
|image557|

If a patron asks to have their hold suspended and you have the
`SuspendHoldsIntranet <#SuspendHoldsIntranet>`__ system preference set
to 'allow' you can do so by clicking the Suspend button to far right. If
the patron gives you a date for the items to become unsuspended you can
enter that in the date box and click the 'Update hold(s)' button to save
your changes.

Hold suspension column
|image558|

To delete or cancel a hold click the red 'X' to the right of the hold
line. To delete/cancel a bunch of holds you can choose 'del' from pull
down to the left of each line and then click 'Update hold(s)' at the
bottom of the list.

Cancel Holds
|image559|

`Receiving Holds <#receiveholds>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When items that are on hold are `checked in <#checkingin>`__ or
`out <#checkingout>`__ the system will remind the circulation librarian
that the item is on hold and offer them options for managing the hold.

When you check in an item that has a hold on it the system will ask you
to either confirm and transfer the item

Confirm Hold & Transfer
|image560|

or just confirm the hold

Confirm Hold
|image561|

Clicking the Confirm button will mark the item as on hold for the
patron. If the item needs to be transferred the item will also be marked
as in transit to the proper branch. Clicking 'Ignore' will retain the
hold, but allow you to check the item out to another patron. Choosing to
confirm and print will present you with a printable page that you can
slip inside the book with the necessary hold and/or transfer
information.

Once confirmed the hold will show on the patron record and on the
checkout screen under the 'Hold' tab.

Hold on Patron Record
|image562|

From here if the patron would like you suspend their holds you can do so
one by one or in bulk.

The item record will also show that the item is on hold.

Hold on Item Record
|image563|

In some cases a patron may come in to pick up a hold for their partner
(or someone else in their household). In this case you want to make sure
that the hold is cancelled when you check the item out to someone else.
When trying to check out an item that is already waiting for someone
else you will be presented with a warning message.

Hold waiting for someone else
|image564|

From here you can check the item out to the patron at the desk and
cancel the hold for the patron.

`Transfers <#transfers>`__
--------------------------

If you work in a multi-branch system you can transfer items from one
library to another by using the Transfer tool.

-  *Get there*: Circulation > Transfer

To transfer an item

-  Click 'Transfer' on the Circulation page

   Transfer Tool
   |image565|

   -  Enter the library you would like to transfer the item to

   -  Scan or type the barcode on the item you would like to transfer

-  Click 'Submit'

   Transfer Summary
   |image566|

-  The item will now say that it is in transit

   Item in Transit
   |image567|

-  When the item arrives at the other branch the librarian must check
   the item in to acknowledge that it is no longer in transit

-  The item will not be permanently moved to the new library

   Item record
   |image568|

   -  The item shows the same 'Home Library' but has updated the
      'Current Location' to note where it resides at this time

`Set Library <#setlibrary>`__
-----------------------------

By default you will enter the staff client as if you are at your home
library. This library will appear in the top right of the Staff Client.

My Library
|image569|

This is the library that all circulation transactions will take place
at. If you are at another library (or on a bookmobile) you will want to
set your library before you start circulating items. To do this you can
click 'Set' at the top right or on the Circulation page.

Set Library Form
|image570|

Once you have saved your changes you new library will appear in the top
right.

`Fast Add Cataloging <#fastaddcat>`__
-------------------------------------

Sometimes circulation librarians need to quickly add a record to the
system for an item they are about to check out. This is called 'Fast
Add.' To allow circulation librarians access to the Fast Add Cataloging
tool, simply make sure they have the
`fast\_cataloging <#fastaddpermissions>`__ permissions. There are two
ways to add titles via fast add. If you know that you're about to check
out an item that isn't in you catalog you can go to the Circulation
module and click 'Fast cataloging.'

Circulation Menu
|image571|

The cataloging interface will open up with the short cataloging record:

Fast Add Framework
|image572|

After adding your cataloging data you will be asked to enter item data.
Enter the items barcode, collection code, etc and save the item before
checking it out.

The other way to fast catalog is from the checkout screen. When you
enter a barcode at checkout that Koha can't find, it will prompt you to
use fast cataloging to add the item to Koha and check it out.

Barcode not found
|image573|

Clicking 'Fast cataloging' will bring you to the fast cataloging form
where you can enter the title information

Fast cataloging
|image574|

After clicking 'Save' you will be brought to the item record where the
barcode will already be filled in with the barcode you're trying to
check out.

Fast cataloging item record
|image575|

After clicking the 'Add item' button the item will automatically be
checked out the patron you were trying to check the book out to
originally.

Checked out item
|image576|

`Circulation Reports <#circreports>`__
--------------------------------------

Most reports can be found via the Reports module, but some of the more
common circulation reports are available right from the Circulation
module.

-  *Get there*: Circulation > Circulation reports

`Holds Queue <#holdsqueue>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you all of the holds at your library.

Sample Holds Queue
|image577|

To generate this report, you must have the `Build Holds Queue cron
job <#buildholdscron>`__ running. This cron job is a script that should
be run periodically if your library system allows borrowers to place
on-shelf holds. This script decides which library should be responsible
for fulfilling a given hold request.

It's behavior is controlled by the system preferences
`StaticHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__ and
`RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__.

If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the on-shelf
holds fulfillment process, you should list the libraries that \*do\*
participate in the process here by inputting all the participating
library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g. "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc.
).

By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system will
first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the pickup
library if possible. If there are no items available at the pickup
library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use the list of
libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled ( which it is by default ), the
script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
small, medium and large ) and you want the burden of holds fulfillment
to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you would want
StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like "LRG,MED,SML".

If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
throughout your library system, simply enable RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight.
When this system preference is enabled, the order in which libraries
will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf hold will be randomized each
time the list is regenerated.

Leaving StaticHoldsQueueWeight empty is contraindicated at this time.
Doing so will cause the build\_holds\_queue script to ignore
RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight, causing the script to request hold
fulfillment not randomly, but by alphabetical order.

`Holds to pull <#holdspull>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you all of the items that have holds on them that
are available at the library for pulling. If the items are available at
multiple branches then all branches with that item available will see
the hold to pull until one library triggers the hold.

Holds to Pull
|image578|

You can limit the results you see by using the Refine box on the left
side of the page:

Refine Holds to Pull Report
|image579|

`Holds awaiting pickup <#holdspickup>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show all of the holds that are waiting for patrons to
pick them up.

Holds Awaiting Pickup
|image580|

Items that have been on the hold shelf longer than you normally allow
(based on the `ReservesMaxPickUpDelay <#ReservesMaxPickUpDelay>`__
preference value) will appear on the 'Holds Over' tab, they will not
automatically be cancelled unless you have set the `cron
job <#expiredholdscron>`__ to do that for you, but you can cancel all
holds using the button at the top of the list.

Items waiting on the hold shelf too long
|image581|

`Hold ratios <#holdratios>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hold ratios help with collection development. Using this report you will
be able to see how many of your patrons have holds on items and whether
you should buy more. By default it will be set to the library needing 3
items per hold that has been placed. The report will tell you how many
additional items need to be purchased to meet this quota.

Hold Ratios
|image582|

`Transfers to receive <#transferstoreceive>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will list all of the items that Koha thinks are in transit
to your library.

Transfers to Receive
|image583|

If your transfers are late in arriving at your library you will see a
message stating how late your items are.

Late transfers include warning messages
|image584|

    **Important**

    An item is considered late based on the number of days you have
    entered in the
    `TransfersMaxDaysWarning <#TransfersMaxDaysWarning>`__ system
    preference.

`Overdues <#overduesreport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Important**

    For libraries with a large patron base, this report may take a
    significant amount of time to run.

    **Note**

    Large libraries can choose to filter the report before it runs by
    setting the
    `FilterBeforeOverdueReport <#FilterBeforeOverdueReport>`__ system
    preference to 'Require'.

This report will list all items that are overdue at your library.

Overdues List
|image585|

The report can be filtered using the menu options found on the left of
the report.

    **Note**

    The 'Show any items currently checked out' checkbox basically
    switches this from a report of overdues to a report of checkouts. It
    will show all titles checked out regardless of due date.

`Overdues with fines <#overduesfines>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report will show you any overdues at your library that have accrued
fines on them.

Overdues with fines
|image586|

If you would like to limit the report you can use the pull down menu at
the top to limit to a specific shelving location at your branch. To see
overdues with fines at other branches you will have to `change your
branch <#setlibrary>`__ or log in at that branch.

    **Important**

    If you do not charge fines and/or don't have the `fines cron
    job <#finescronjob>`__ running you will see no data on this report.

`Pending on-site checkouts <#pendingonsite>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the on site checkouts functionality
(`OnSiteCheckouts <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__) then you'll have a report to
view all items that are currently checked out on site.Pending onsite
checkouts

This will list the due date (overdues in red), who has the item, item
information and what library the item is at.

`Tracking In house Use <#trackinhouse>`__
-----------------------------------------

Many libraries track the use of items within the library.

    **Note**

    This is different from tracking on site usage. In house use is the
    use of items in the library by patrons without them having to check
    them out. On site use is the use of items on site that must first be
    checked out. To learn more about on site usage please review the
    `OnSiteCheckouts <#OnSiteCheckouts>`__ preference.

Tracking the use of items in the library without checking them out can
be done in Koha one of two ways. The first is to create one or more
`Statistical Patrons <#addstatspatron>`__. When collecting items that
have been used within the library, you will want to check them out to
your statistical patron:

Check Out Items to Stats Patron
|image587|

Instead of marking the item as 'checked out' the system will record that
the item was used in house:

Local Use Recorded
|image588|

Repeat these steps for all items that have been used within the library
to keep accurate statistics for item use.

The other way to record local use of items is to set your
`RecordLocalUseOnReturn <#RecordLocalUseOnReturn>`__ preference to
'Record.' Then whenever you check an item in that is not checked out and
not on hold a local use will be recorded.

Local Use Recorded
|image589|

    **Note**

    If you have `RecordLocalUseOnReturn <#RecordLocalUseOnReturn>`__ set
    to 'Record' you can still use your statistical patrons to record
    local use as well.

`In Processing / Book Cart Locations <#processinglocations>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------

Koha allows for handling temporary locations like the processing center
and/or book carts throughout the library. For this feature to work you
must first make sure you have `authorized values <#authorizedvalues>`__
set in the `LOC <#shelvelocvals>`__ category for PROC (Processing
Center) and CART (Book Cart).

CART & PROC values in LOC
|image590|

Next you need to set the
`NewItemsDefaultLocation <#NewItemsDefaultLocation>`__ system preference
to PROC. This will set the new items to the Processing Center as their
default location.

When creating items you enter in their desired final shelving location
and Koha will temporarily change that to PROC. If
`InProcessingToShelvingCart <#InProcessingToShelvingCart>`__ is set to
"Don't move" then when an item with a location of PROC is checked in it
will either automatically update the item to use the permanent location.
If `InProcessingToShelvingCart <#InProcessingToShelvingCart>`__ is set
to "Move" then when an item is checked in the location is changed from
PROC to CART.

A `cron job <#proccartcron>`__ is then set to run at specified intervals
to age items from CART to the permanent shelving location. (For example,
an hourly cron entry of cart\_to\_shelf.pl --hours 3 where --hours is
the amount of time an item should spend on the cart before aging to its
permanent location.)

-  **Note**

       If the `ReturnToShelvingCart <#ReturnToShelvingCart>`__ system
       preference is set to "Move", any newly checked-in item is also
       automatically put into the shelving cart, to be covered by the
       same script run.

-  **Important**

       Checkins with confirmed holds will not go into the shelving cart.
       If items on the shelving cart are checked out, the cart location
       will be cleared.

`Self Checkout <#selfcheckout>`__
---------------------------------

Koha comes with a very basic self checkout module. To enable this module
you need to set the `WebBasedSelfCheck <#WebBasedSelfCheck>`__
preference to 'Enable.' To use this module you have to log in as a
`staff member <#addstaffpatron>`__ with `circulation
permissions <#patronpermissions>`__.

    **Note**

    Create a `staff patron <#addstaffpatron>`__ specifically for this
    action so that you don't leave a real staff client logged into a
    computer all day

There is no link to the Self Checkout module, but a simple addition to
the `IntranetUserJS <#intranetuserjs>`__ system preference can add one.

::

    $(document).ready(function(){ $("#login
          #submit").parent().after("<p><a
          href=\"http://YOUR_KOHA_OPAC_URL/cgi-bin/koha/sco/sco-main.pl\"
          target=\"_blank\">Self-Checkout</a></p>"); }); 

    **Important**

    The code above has line breaks added to make it more readable,
    please be sure to enter the above as one line in when putting it in
    the system preference.

The link will then appear at the bottom of the log in page:

Self Checkout Link on Staff Login
|image591|

You can also access this module by going to :
http://YOUR\_KOHA\_OPAC\_URL/cgi-bin/koha/sco/sco-main.pl

When on the self checkout page depending on your value in the
`SelfCheckoutByLogin <#SelfCheckoutByLogin>`__ preference you will be
asked to enter you cardnumber

Self Checkout Patron Card Number
|image592|

or your username and password:

Shelf checkout by login
|image593|

Once you're logged in to the self check module you will be asked to scan
the items you are checking out

Self Checkout
|image594|

As you scan items they will appear below the barcode box

Self Checkout Summary
|image595|

When you are finished scanning items it is important to click the
'Finish' button. This will prompt you to print a receipt and log you out
of the self check module.

Self Checkout Receipt
|image596|

When attempting to check items out there are some instances where error
messages will appear and the patron will be directed to the librarian.
This will happen even if you are allowing overrides on circulation
functions. Only a librarian can override a circulation block and so
patrons must go to the librarian for help in these situations.

Self Checkout Error Message
|image597|

`Offline Circulation Utilities <#offlinecirc>`__
------------------------------------------------

Koha allows for you to continue circulation actions while offline by
using any one of three utilities.

`Offline Circulation in Koha <#kohaofflinecirc>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the `AllowOfflineCirculation <#AllowOfflineCirculation>`__ preference
is set to 'Enable' the library staff can continue to perform circulation
actions within Koha when the system is offline. You will want to visit
http://your-koha-staff-client-url/cgi-bin/koha/circ/offline.pl at least
once while online and bookmark that page. That is the page you will go
to when you are offline.

    **Important**

    The offline interface uses HTML LocalStorage, which depending on the
    browser and user setting, is limited to 2.5MB or 5MB per domain.
    This means that larger systems will not be able to synchronize their
    data and are recommended to use either the
    `Firefox <#firefoxofflinecirc>`__ or
    `Windows <#windowsofflinecirc>`__ application for offline
    circulation.

`Setup <#kohaofflinesetup>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the first time the system goes offline go to Circulation and
choose 'Built-in offline circulation interface'

Built-in offline circulation interface
|image598|

And synchronize your data on every circulation computer by clicking the
'Synchronize' link on the right of the screen.

Synchronize data
|image599|

    **Important**

    The offline interface uses HTML LocalStorage, which depending on the
    browser and user setting, is limited to 2.5MB or 5MB per domain.
    This means that larger systems will not be able to synchronize their
    data and are recommended to use either the
    `Firefox <#firefoxofflinecirc>`__ or
    `Windows <#windowsofflinecirc>`__ application for offline
    circulation.

This will allow you download a local copy of your patrons and
circulation data. Click the 'Download records' link at the top of the
page to synchronize your data.

Download records for offline use
|image600|

Once your data is downloaded you will see the dates your data was last
synced to the right of each data set.Synced offline dataThis should be
done regularly in preparation for any unexpected connection losses.

`Circulating <#kohaofflinecirculating>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When your system goes offline visit the Offline Circulation page
(http://your-koha-staff-client-url/cgi-bin/koha/circ/offline.pl) in Koha
and click 'Check out' or 'Check in' to perform offline actions.

Checking out is done by searching for the patron by barcode or name at
the top of the 'Check out' screen. After selecting a patron you will be
presented with the synced patron info, including fines and check outs.

Check out offline
|image601|

Scan the barcode of the item you would like to check out and enter a due
date. If you don't enter a due date Koha will prompt you for one.

Offline due date
|image602|

Once the item is checked out it will appear below the patron's info.

`Koha Offline Uploading <#kohaofflineupload>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the system is back online visit the Synchronize page on the Offline
Circulation module and click 'Upload transactions'

Upload transactions
|image604|

After the files are uploaded you can click 'View pending offline
circulation actions' on the right.

View pending offline circulation actions
|image605|

After clicking 'View pending offline circulation actions' you will be
brought to a summary of all of the actions you loaded in to Koha in your
\*.koc file.

Offline Circulation
|image606|

-  Once all of the logs from all of the circulation computers are loaded
   you will be able to check them all or select just those you want to
   process into Koha.

-  Click on the Process button and Koha will record every stored
   transaction one by one. For each transaction, the status will change
   to:

   -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

   -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

   -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

   -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

Once finished you will have a summary of all of your transactions

`Firefox Plugin <#firefoxofflinecirc>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an offline circulation tool that you can add to your Firefox
browser as an addon. To do so, just go to
https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/koct/ page and click on the
"install now" button. You may have to confirm the installation, just
click on "install now" and then restart Firefox to complete the
installation.

Once you have installed the plugins and restarted Firefox, you will see
the Koha logo in the download bar at the bottom right of Firefox.

Koha Icon on Add-on Bar
|image608|

A click on the logo will open the tool in its own window.

Koha Offline Circ Tool
|image609|

The plugin consists of four tabs:

-  The Check Out tab is where you check out items

-  The Check In tab is where you check in items

-  The Log tab keeps track of every transaction done while in offline
   mode

   -  The log will keep information until you empty it. Each time you
      open the plugin and it contains data in the log it will warn you

      Koha Offline Circ Warning
      |image610|

      If you'd like to clear the log, check the 'I want to delete rows'
      box before hitting the 'OK' button. Otherwise clicking 'OK' will
      keep the items in the log and let you continue working with the
      tool.

-  The Param tab is to set up the plugin

The first thing you want to do then is to set up the plugin. Go to the
Param tab to set up the plugin

Koha Offline CIrc Params
|image611|

Answer the 4 questions presented:

-  Server = the URL of the librarian interface

-  Branch Code = the code for the branch where you are located

-  Username = your staff account login

-  Password = your staff account password

    **Important**

    To save the settings, you will have to close the plugin window and
    re-open it by clicking again on the Koha logo in the add-on bar.

    **Note**

    You can create a staff account dedicated to the offline circulation.
    So that, no matter who is at the circulation desk, they can all use
    the same login. Along those lines, you can use a group login that
    you already have in place for circulation as well.

Once you have everything set up you can start checking items in and out.

Checking out:

Koha Offline Circulation Check Out
|image612|

-  Go to the Check Out tab

-  Scan the patron barcode

-  Scan the item barcode

-  Click 'Save'

Checking in:

Koha Offline Circulation Check In
|image613|

-  Go to the Check In tab

-  Scan the item barcode

-  Click Save

Each time, you check out or check in an item, a new transaction is
recorded in the local plugin database and you will see, at the bottom of
the plugin how many transactions has been made during the offline
circulation. For example, "10 Row(s) Added" means you did 10
transactions.

Koha Offline Circulation Tool Count
|image614|

Then, if you want an overview of every transaction, go to the Log tab.
This tab will show you the transactions in the plugin database

Koha Offline Circulation Log
|image615|

    **Note**

    The status will be "Local." as long as you are offline and don't
    process the transactions into Koha.

When your Internet connection comes back up you will want to get these
transactions in to Koha. Before processing these transactions you should
be aware of a few issues.

Because you are not connected to your Koha database when using this
plugin holds will need additional processing. If an item you check in
while offline has a hold, the hold is kept on the item. Since, you can't
confirm holds found during the processing of every check in, the holds
stay on the item and will need to be managed later. If you only checked
in a few items you can just keep a record of them all. If you checked in
a lot of items you can use the Holds Queue once it rebuilds to see what
holds made it to the shelf erroneously.

Similarly, if an patron card was expired, the offline circulation tool
won't know about it, so the checkout will be recorded regardless of the
patron's account being blocked normally.

You have two options for adding this data to Koha

-  Commit to Koha

   -  If you checked in/out on more than one computer at the same time,
      what you want is to process every transaction consistently. Let's
      say for instance that one patron checked a book out on one
      computer and then checked the same book in on another computer. To
      be consistent, you need to record the check out first and then the
      check in. Not the opposite! To do so, you need to group every
      transaction in one place, sort them all and then, process
      everything. So, you need to use the "Commit to Koha" option from
      every plugin/computer you worked with. This way, the log will go
      to Koha and be accessible from the Offline Circulation page.

   -  Once all of the logs from all of the circulation computers are
      loaded you will be able to check them all or select just those you
      want to process into Koha.

   -  Click on the Process button and Koha will record every stored
      transaction one by one. For each transaction, the status will
      change to:

      -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

      -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

      -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

      -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

   -  Once finished you will have a summary of all of your transactions

      |image618|

-  Apply directly

   -  If you performed all of the circulation actions on one computer
      then everything is sorted already so you can choose to "Apply
      directly"

   -  The status column will be updated to let you know if the
      transactions were applied

      -  "Success." if the transaction was processed correctly

      -  "Borrower not found." if the borrower card number is incorrect

      -  "Item not found." if the item barcode is wrong

      -  "Item not issued." if you checked in an available item

   -  Once you're finished you can review all of the items right in the
      Log tab

Cataloging
==========

Before you start cataloging in Koha you're going to want to do some
basic setup. Refer to the `Implementation Checklist <#implementation>`__
for a full list of these things. Most importantly you're going to want
to make sure that your `Frameworks <#marcbibframeworks>`__ are all
defined the way you want. Once in the cataloging module you will not be
able to add or remove fields and subfields so your frameworks must be
ready before you start cataloging.

You can also use OCLC Connexion to send records directly in to Koha. For
more information on that please review the `OCLC Connexion Setup
appendix <#oclcappendix>`__.

-  *Get there:* More > Cataloging

`Bibliographic Records <#catbibs>`__
------------------------------------

In Koha the bibliographic record contains the main information related
to the material. This includes things like the title, author, ISBN, etc.
This information is stored in Koha in Marc (different flavors of Marc
are supported in Koha). Once this information is saved, `items or
holdings <#catitems>`__ can be attached.

`Adding Records <#addbibrec>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Records can be added to Koha via original or copy cataloging. You can
also choose to use the basic or advanced cataloging interface for all of
your work.

   -  Deletes the first ‡b subfield on the first 245 to ‡b

`Adding Analytic Records <#cataloganalytics>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries sometimes make journal articles and articles within monographs
and serials accessible to library patrons through analytics cataloging.
Analytics cataloging creates separate bibliographic records for these
articles, chapters, sections, etc. found within a larger resource such
as a book, an article within a journal, newspaper or serial. In
analytics cataloging, although a separate bib record is created for the
title, it is not physically separated from the host item.  Learn more
about Analytics in Chapter 13 of AACR2.

If you would like to catalog analytic records there are two options. One
is to use the `Easy Analytics <#catalogeasyanalytics>`__ funtion; the
other is the `Analytics Enhanced Workflow <#catalogenhanceanalytics>`__.

`Easy Analytics <#catalogeasyanalytics>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Easy Analytics feature makes linking analytic records together
easier. The first thing you need to do is set the
`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ preference to
'Display' and the `UseControlNumber <#UseControlNumber>`__ preference to
'Don't use.'

After cataloging your analytic record (see `Adding
Records <#addbibrec>`__ for more on creating records) click 'Edit' from
the normal view and choose to 'Link to Host Item'

Link to Host Item
|image646|

This will prompt you to enter the barcode for the item this record
should be linked to.

Barcode for Analytic Linking
|image647|

After entering the item's barcode and clicking 'Select' you will receive
a confirmation message.

Analytic Link Success
|image648|

The record will now have the 773 field filled in properly to complete
the link.

773
|image649|

To view all of the items tied to the host record, do a search for the
record, click the Analytics tab on the left and the analytics tied to
each barcode will be shown under the "Used in" column.

Analytics Tab
|image650|

    **Note**

    It is also possible to create analytic records from this screen by
    clicking on "Create Analytics"

You can also see the analytics attached to this record by clicking the
'Show Analytic' link towards the top of the record in the normal view.

Show Analytics on Bib Record
|image651|

When looking at the anaytic record you will also see a link to the host
item under the 'Host records' column in the holdings table when viewing
the 'Analtyics' tab.

Host Record
|image652|

`Analytics Enhanced Workflow <#catalogenhanceanalytics>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the Enhanced Workflow method of adding analytics, the first thing
you need to do is set the
`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ preference to 'Don't
display' and the `UseControlNumber <#UseControlNumber>`__ preference to
'Use.'

After cataloging your original record (see `Adding
Records <#addbibrec>`__ for more on creating records) click 'New' from
the normal view and choose to 'New child record.'

New child record
|image653|

This will open a new blank record for cataloging. The blank record will
only have the 773 field filled in properly to complete the link once the
record is saved.

To view all of the items tied to the host record, do a search for the
record, click the Analytics tab on the left and the analytics tied to
each barcode will be shown under the "Used in" column.

|image657|

`Editing Analytics <#analyticediting>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have linked an analytic record incorrectly you can remove that
link by editing the item on the analytic record (not the host record).
To do this, go to the analytic record and click the 'Edit' button and
choose to 'Edit items'. To the left of each item you will see two
options.

Edit Analytic Item Record
|image658|

-  Clicking 'Edit in Host' will allow you to edit the item on the host
   record.

-  Clicking 'Delink' will remove the 773 field and the link between the
   analytic and the host.

|image662|

Once you choose that you will be brought to a Z39.50 search window to
search other libraries for the record in question.

Once you have made your edits (via either method) you can click 'Save'
at the top left of the editor.

You can also use the edit menu to add your own custom cover image if you
have either `OPACLocalCoverImages <#OPACLocalCoverImages>`__ and/or
`LocalCoverImages <#LocalCoverImages>`__ set to 'Display' by choosing
'Upload Image' from the menu.

|image663|

Choosing to 'Upload Image' will take you to the `Upload Local Cover
Image Tool <#uploadlocalimages>`__.

`Duplicating Records <#dupbibrec>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a copy of the record you need to catalog can't be found via
Z39.50. In these cases you can create a duplicate of similar record and
edit the necessary pieces to create a new record. To duplicate an
existing record click 'Edit as New (Duplicate)' from the Edit menu on
the Bibliographic Record

Edit as New (Duplicate) Bibliographic Record
|image664|

This will open a new MARC record with the fields filled in with the
values from the original Bibliographic Record.

New Duplicate Record
|image665|

`Attaching files to Records <#uploadbibfile>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to upload files to Koha you can do so with a few
settings.

-  You will need to ask your system administrator to set the
   'upload\_path' config variable to point to where the files will be
   stored

   -  You can see if your upload path is set correctly by visiting About
      Koha > System Information. If there is an error you will see it
      there.Upload Path Warning

-  You will want to be sure that your `OPACBaseURL <#OPACBaseURL>`__
   system preference is set appropriately

-  You will want to add the upload.pl plugin to the 856$u subfield in
   one (or multiple) of your `frameworks <#editsubfields>`__

Once you are all set up you can continue with cataloging as regular. You
will see a plugin icon next to the 856$u that will open up the upload
and/or search windowUpload file to record

From this menu you can click browse to find a file and attach it, or you
can search files you have uploaded previously using the search box. From
the search results you can choose which file to attach.Uploaded files

Once the file is chosen it will appear as a link in the MARC record and
on the detail display.

`Merging Records <#mergebibs>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To merge bibliographic records together you will want to go to the
Cataloging module and perform a search.

If you see duplicates on that search results screen you can check the
boxes next to the duplicates and click the 'Merge selected' button at
the top of the results.

Once you have selected the records you want to merge, click the 'Merge
selected' button at the top of the list. You will be asked which of the
records you would like to keep as your primary record and which will be
deleted after the merge. If the records were created using different
frameworks, Koha will also ask you what Framework you would like the
newly merged record to use.

Choose Primary Record for Merge
|image666|

You will be presented with the MARC for all of the records (each
accessible by tabs labeled with the bib numbers for those records). By
default the entire first record will be selected, uncheck the fields you
don't want in the final (destination) record and then move on to the
second tab to choose which fields should be in the final (destination)
record.

Merging Records
|image667|

Should you try to add a field that is not repeatable two times (like
choosing the 245 field from both record #1 and #2) you will be presented
with an error

Non-repeatable Error
|image668|

Below the records you are merging is an option to enter fields to report
on. This will allow you to control what fields you see on the merge
confirmation page:

Merge report fields
|image669|

If you enter nothing you will be presented with a confirmation of
biblionumbers only

Merge report
|image670|

If you enter fields you will see those on the confirmation page (you can
set defaults with the `MergeReportFields <#MergeReportFields>`__
preference)

Merge report
|image671|

Once you have completed your selections click the 'merge' button. The
primary record will now CONTAIN the data you chose for it as well as all
of the items/holdings from both bib records, and the second record will
be deleted.

    **Important**

    It is important to rebuild your zebra index immediately after
    merging records. If a search is performed for a record which has
    been deleted Koha will present the patrons with an error in the
    OPAC.

    **Note**

    If you would like you can also use the `Lists <#lists>`__ tool for
    merging records together. `Learn more here <#mergebibrecs>`__.

`Deleting Records <#deleterecord>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a bibliographic record simply choose the 'Edit' button and
select 'Delete record'

Delete record
|image672|

Bibliographic records can only be deleted one all items have been
deleted. If you try to delete a bibliographic record with items still
attached you will see that the delete option is grayed out.

Record with items still attached
|image673|

`Item Records <#catitems>`__
----------------------------

In Koha each bibliographic record can have one or more items attached.
These items are sometimes referred to as holdings. Each item includes
information to the physical copy the library has.

`Adding Items <#addingitems>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After saving a new bibliographic record, you will be redirected to a
blank item record so that you can attach an item to the bibliographic
record. You can also click 'Add/Edit Items' from the cataloging search
results

Add/Edit Items Option on Search Results
|image674|

or you can add new item at any time by clicking 'New' on the
bibliographic record and choosing 'New Item'

New Item Button
|image675|

The item edit form will appear:

Add item form
|image676|

At the very least, if you plan on circulating the item, the following
fields should be entered for new items:

-  2 - Source of classification

-  a - Permanent location

-  b - Current location

-  o - Full call number

   -  If you'd like you can use the `call number browser
      plugin <#cnbrowseplugin>`__ for this field. If it's enabled you'll
      see a ... to the right of the field. When clicked that will open a
      call number browser window if the row is highlighted in Red then
      the call number is in use, if there is a thin Green line instead
      then the call number can be used.Call number browser

-  p - Barcode

-  v - Cost, replacement price

   -  This value will be charged to patrons when you mark an item they
      have checked out as 'Lost'

-  y - Koha item type

To make sure that these values are filled in you can mark them as
mandatory in the `framework <#marcbibframeworks>`__ you're using and
then they will appear in red with a 'required' label. The item will not
save until the required fields are filled in.

Required Item Subfield
|image677|

-  **Note**

       To make item subfields required in a framework you'll want to
       edit the 952 field in the `framework
       editor <#marcbibframeworks>`__.

Below the add form there are 3 buttons for adding the item

Add Item Buttons
|image678|

-  Add Item will add just the one item

-  Add & Duplicate will add the item and fill in a new form with the
   same values for your to alter

-  Add Multiple items will ask how many items and will then add that
   number of items adding +1 to the barcode so each barcode is unique

Your added items will appear above the add form once submitted

Items
|image679|

Your items will also appear below the bibliographic details on the bib
record display.

List of Items on the Bib Record
|image680|

If you have
`SpineLabelShowPrintOnBibDetails <#SpineLabelShowPrintOnBibDetails>`__
set to 'Display' then there will also be a link to print a quick spine
label next to each item.

   Edit items in a batch
   |image687|

   This will open up the `batch item modification
   tool <#batchmodifyitems>`__ where you can edit all of the items on
   this record as a batch.

-  You can also enable
   `StaffDetailItemSelection <#StaffDetailItemSelection>`__ to have
   checkboxes appear to the left of each item on the detail display. You
   can then check off the items you would like to edit and click 'Modify
   selected items' at the top of the list.

   Editing selected items
   |image688|

-  You can click 'Edit' to the right of each item in the Holdings
   tabEdit individual items

-  There is also a link to Edit items from the search results in the
   staff clientEdit item on the search results

-  Finally you can use the `Batch Item
   Modification <#batchmodifyitems>`__ tool

`Quick Item Status Updates <#itemquickedit>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often circulation staff need to change the status of an item to Lost or
Damaged. This doesn't require you to edit the entire item record.
Instead clicking on the item barcode on the checkout summary or checkin
history will bring you to an item summary. You can also get to the item
summary by clicking on the Items tab to the left of the bib detail page.

Item Edit
|image689|

From this view you can mark an item lost by choosing a lost status from
the pull down and clicking the 'Set Status' button.

Edit Lost Status
|image690|

You can also mark an item as damaged by choosing a damaged status from
the pull down and clicking the 'Set Status' button.

Edit Damaged Status
|image691|

`Duplicating Items <#duplicateitem>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can easily duplicate each item by clicking the 'Action' button the
left of each item on the edit items screen

Edit individual items
|image692|

From here you can choose to 'Duplicate' the item and this will populate
the form with the values from the item you chose.

`Item Information <#iteminfo>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To the left of every bibliographic record there is a tab to view the
items.

Items Tab
|image693|

Clicking that tab will give you basic information about the items. From
here you can see basic information about the item such as the home
library, item type, collection code, call number and replacement price.
You can also see and edit the status information. If an item is marked
lost or withdrawn you will also see the date that status was applied.

In the History section you will see infomration about the check out
history of the item and if you ordered the item via the acquisitions
module then this section will include information about the order.

History with order info
|image694|

If the Order or Accession date is linked, clicking it will bring you to
the acquisitions information for that item.

`Moving Items <#moveitemrec>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Items can be moved from one bibliographic record to another using the
Attach Item option

Attach Item Option
|image695|

Visit the bibliographic record you want to attach the item to and choose
'Attach Item' from the 'Edit' menu.

Attach Item Form
|image696|

Simply enter the barcode for the item you want to move and click
'Select'

If you want to move all items to a new record creating only one
bibliographic record you can use the `Merge Records
tool <#mergebibrecs>`__ instead.

`Deleting Items <#deleteitems>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways to delete item records. If you only need to delete
one item you can do this by opening up the detail page for the bib
record and clicking the 'Edit' button at the top. From there you can
choose to 'Edit items'.

'Edit Items' menu option
|image697|

You will be presented with a list of items and next to each one will be
a link labeled 'Delete'. Click that link and if the item is not checked
out it will delete that item.

Delete link on the left
|image698|

If you know that all of the items attached to your record are not
currently checked out you can use the 'Delete all items' option under
the 'Edit menu' and it will remove all items from the record.

You can also enable
`StaffDetailItemSelection <#StaffDetailItemSelection>`__ to have
checkboxes appear to the left of each item on the detail display. You
can then check off the items you would like to delete and click 'Delete
selected items' at the top of the list.

Deleting selected items
|image699|

Finally you can use the `batch delete tool <#batchdeleteitems>`__ to
delete a batch of items.

`Item Specific Circulation History <#itemcirchistory>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each bibliographic record keeps a circulation history (with or without
the patron information depending on your settings), but each item also
has its own circulation history page. To see this, click on the 'Items'
tab to the left of the record you are viewing.

Items tab
|image700|

Below the 'History' heading is a link to 'View item's checkout history,'
clicking that will open up the item's history which will look slightly
different from the bibliographic record's history page.

|image701|

`Authorities <#catauthorities>`__
---------------------------------

Authority records are a way of controlling fields in your MARC records.
Using authority records will provide you with control over subject
headings, personal names and places.

`Adding Authorities <#addauthorities>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new authority record you can either choose the authority type
from the 'New Authority' button or search another library by clicking
the 'New from Z39.50' button.

New Authority Record Options
|image702|

If you choose to enter a new authority from scratch, the form that
appears will allow you to enter all of the necessary details regarding
your authority record.

New Authority Record
|image703|

To expand collapsed values simply click on the title and the subfields
will appear. To duplicate a field or subfield just click the plus sign
(+) to the right of the label. To use field helper plugins simply click
the ellipsis (...) to the right of the field.

When linking authorities to other headings, you can use the authority
finder plugin by clicking the ellipsis (...) to the right of the field.

Authority search plugin
|image704|

From there you can search your authority file for the authority to link.
If you can't find the authority to link, you can click the 'Create new'
button and add the necessary authority for the link. This plugin also
allows for you to choose the link relationship between the authorities.

Authority relationships
|image705|

If you choose to search another library for the authority record you
will be presented with a search box

Authority Z39.50 Search
|image706|

From the results you can choose the 'Import' link to the right of the
record you would like to add to Koha

Authority Z39.50 Results
|image707|

You will then be presented with the form to edit the authority before
saving it to your system

Imported Authority
|image708|

`Searching Authorities <#searchauthorities>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the authorities page you can search for existing terms and the
bibliographic records they are attached to.

Authority Search
|image709|

From the results you will see the authority record, how many
bibliographic records it is attached to, an 'Actions' menu that includes
the ability to `edit <#editauthorities>`__, `merge <#authoritymerge>`__
and `delete <#editauthorities>`__ (if there are no bibliographic records
attached).

Authority Search Results
|image710|

Clicking on the Details link to the right of the authority record
summary will open the full record and the option to edit the record.

Authority Record
|image711|

If the authority has See Alsos in it you will see those broken out on
the search results, clicking the linked headings will run a search for
that heading instead.

See Also in Authorities
|image712|

`Editing Authorities <#editauthorities>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authorities can be edited by clicking on the authority summary from the
search results and then clicking the 'Edit' button above the record. Or
by clicking on the 'Edit' link to the left of the authority on the
search results.

Edit Authority Record
|image713|

Once you've made the necessary edits, simply click 'Save' and
`dontmerge <#dontmerge>`__ is set to 'Do', Koha will immediately update
all of the bib records linked to the authority with the new authority
record's data. If dontmerge is set to "Don't" then Koha won't edit bib
records when changes are made to authorities, rather, this is done later
by the `merge\_authority.pl cronjob <#mergeauthcron>`__.

To delete an authority record you first must make sure it's not linked
to any bibliographic records. If it is not used by any bibliographic
records a 'Delete' link will appear to the right of the record on the
search results and as a button that appears after clicking on the
summary of the authority record.

`Merging Authorities <#authoritymerge>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have duplicate authority records you can merge them together by
clicking the 'Merge' link, found in the actions menu, next to two
results on an authority search.

Duplicate authorities results
|image714|

After clicking 'Merge' on the first result you will see that authority
listed at the top of the results.

Merging authorities results
|image715|

Next you need to click 'Merge' next to the second result you'd like to
merge.

You will be asked which of the two records you would like to keep as
your primary record and which will be deleted after the merge.

Merging authorities
|image716|

You will be presented with the MARC for both of the records (each
accessible by tabs labeled with the authority numbers for those
records). By default the entire first record will be selected, uncheck
the fields you don't want in the final (destination) record and then
move on to the second tab to choose which fields should be in the final
(destination) record.

Authorities to merge
|image717|

Once you have completed your selections click the 'Merge' button. The
primary record will now contain the data you chose for it and the second
record will be deleted.

`Handling On Order Items and Holds <#onorderitemholds>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you tend to import your MARC records when you have ordered the book
(as opposed to when you receive the books), and allow patrons to place
holds on those books, you may need to add item records to the \*.mrc
file before importing.

The easiest way to import your latest order is to first run your records
through `MARCEdit <http://marcedit.reeset.net/>`__. Download your MARC
records, saving them to your desktop or some other location you use/will
remember. If you have MARCEdit already installed you should simply have
to double click on your MARC records, and they will automatically open
in MARCEdit.

    **Important**

    This tutorial was written with MARCEdit version 5.2.3769.41641 on
    Windows XP, instructions may be different if your version or
    operating system is different.

-  Your original file will automatically be in the input; ensure
   MarcBreaker is chosen, and then click "Execute"

   MarcBreaker
   |image719|

-  You will be presented with a summary of the records processed at the
   bottom of the screen

   MarcBreaker Summary
   |image720|

-  Click 'Edit Records' to continue on to adding item records

-  Your screen will be replaced with a larger screen containing the MARC
   records

   MARC file for editing
   |image721|

-  Click on Tools > Add/Edit Field

   Add/Delete Field
   |image722|

-  Enter in the Koha specific item info

   Add 942 Field
   |image723|

   -  In the Field box, type 942

   -  In the Field Data box, type \\\\$c and the item type code
      (\\\\$cBOOK in this example)

   -  Check the 'Insert last' option

   -  Click 'Add Field'

-  Enter in the item record data

   Add 952 Field
   |image724|

   -  In the Field box, type 952

   -  In the Field Data box, type
      $7ORDERED\_STATUS$aPERM\_LOC$bCURR\_LOC$cSHELVING\_LOCATION$eSOURCE\_OF\_ACQ$yITEM\_TYPE

      -  ex. $7-1$aCPL$bCPL$cNEW$eBrodart$yBOOK

         -  In a default install of Koha -1 is the value for the Ordered
            status

      -  You may want to look at other subfields you would like data in
         -- for example, changing the collection code to put all the
         items in the same collection (8), automatically fill in the
         acquisition date (d), or put in a public note (z).

      -  Be sure you use the $ to separate subfields; adding each
         subfield on a separate line will cause that many items to be
         imported with your MARC record (in the example above, four
         items, each with one of those subfields corrected)

      -  Make sure you look at the Administration > Authorized Values in
         Koha to put the correct code into the field

   -  Check the 'Insert last' option

   -  Click 'Add Field'

-  Close the field editor window

-  Click on File > Compile into MARC

   Compile into MARC
   |image725|

-  Choose where to save your file

Now you want to go into your Koha system and follow the instructions for
`importing MARC records <#stagemarc>`__.

Once the item has come in, you will need to go to the item record and
individually change the item to have the correct barcode, and manually
change the status from Ordered to the blank line in the Not for Loan
field.

    **Note**

    If you purchase your cataloged item records, you may want to request
    your vendor put in the information you need into the MARC records
    for you; that way, you could import the edited-by-the-vendor file,
    overwriting the current record, automatically replacing the data
    with what you need.

Course Reserves
===============

The course reserves module in Koha allows you to temporarily move items
to 'reserve' and assign different circulation rules to these items while
they are being used for a specific course.

`Course Reserves Setup <#coursesetup>`__
----------------------------------------

Before using Course Reserves you will need to do some set up.

First you will need to enable course reserves by setting the
`UseCourseReserves <#UseCourseReserves>`__ preference to 'Use'.

Next you will need to have all of your course instructors `added as
patrons <#addnewpatron>`__.

Next you will want to add a couple of new `authorized
values <#newauthval>`__ for Departments and Terms.

You may also want to create new `item types <#additemtype>`__,
`collection codes <#ccode>`__ and/or `shelving
locations <#shelvelocvals>`__ to make it clear that the items are on
reserve to your patrons. You will also want to be sure to confirm that
your `circulation and fine rules <#circfinerules>`__ are right for your
new item types (whether they be hourly or daily loans).

`Adding Courses <#addingcourses>`__
-----------------------------------

Once you have completed your set up for Course Reserves you can start
creating courses and adding titles to the reserve list.

Course Reserves Admin
|image726|

From the main course reserves page you can add a new course by clicking
the 'New course' button at the top left.

Add a new course
|image727|

Your new course will need a Department, Number and Name at the bare
minimum. You can also add in additional details like course section
number and term. To link an instructor to this course simply start
typing their name and Koha will search your patron database to find you
the right person.

Instrcutor search
|image728|

Once the instructor you want appears just click their name and they will
be added. You can repeat this for all instructors on this course. Each
instructor will appear above the search box and can be removed by
clicking the 'Remove' link to the right of their name.

Instructors
|image729|

If you would like your course to show publicly you'll want to be sure to
check the 'Enabled?' box before saving your new course.

Once your course is saved it will show on the main course reserves page
and be searchable by any field in the course.

Courses
|image730|

`Adding Reserve Materials <#addreserves>`__
-------------------------------------------

Before adding reserve materials you will need at least one course to add
them to. To add materials visit the Course Reserves module.

Courses
|image731|

Click on the title of the course you would like to add materials to.

Course administration
|image732|

At the top of the course description click the 'Add reserves' button to
add titles to this reserve list. You will be asked to enter the barcode
for the reserve item.

Add item to reserve
|image733|

After you are done scanning the barcodes to add to the course you can
see them on the course page

Course with reserves
|image734|

`Course Reserves in the OPAC <#opaccoursereserves>`__
-----------------------------------------------------

Once you have enabled Course Reserves and added courses you will see a
link to Course Reserves below your search box in the OPAC.

Course Reserves Link
|image735|

Clicking that link will show you your list of enabled courses (if you
have only one course you will just see the contents of that one course).

Course list in the OPAC
|image736|

You can search course reserves by any field (course number, course name,
instructor name, department) that is visible in the list of courses.
Clicking a course name will show you the details and reserve items.

Serials
=======

Serials actions can be accessed by going to the More menu at the top of
your screen and choosing Serials or by clicking Serials on the main Koha
staff client page. The Serials module in Koha is used for keeping track
of journals, newspapers and other items that come on a regular schedule.
As with all modules, make sure you go through the related
`Implementation Checklist <#impserials>`__ before using the Serials
module.

-  *Get there:* More > Serials

`Manage Serial Frequencies <#serialfreq>`__
-------------------------------------------

Koha keeps a record of publication frequencies for easy management and
duplication.

-  *Get there:* More > Serials > Manage frequencies

From this page you can view all of the existing frequencies in your
system

Frequencies
|image738|

and create new ones.

New frequency
|image739|

`Manage Serial Numbering Patterns <#serialpatterns>`__
------------------------------------------------------

Everytime you create a new numbering pattern in serials you can save it
for later use. These patters are accessible via the Manage numbering
patterns page.

-  *Get there:* More > Serials > Manage numbering patterns

This page will list for you the numbering patterns you have saved in the
past as well as a few canned patterns.

Number patterns
|image740|

    **Note**

    If you have upgraded from a previous version of Koha you will see
    'Backup patterns' listed for patterns used in version before Koha
    3.14. This is how Koha saved your old numbering patterns. You can
    edit these to give them more meaningful names from here.

It will also allow you to create a new numbering pattern without first
adding a subscription. To add new new pattern click 'New numbering
pattern' at the top of the list of patterns.

New number pattern
|image741|

`Custom Subscription Fields <#serialfields>`__
----------------------------------------------

This module will allow you to add custom fields to your serial
subscriptions for reporting and searching.

-  *Get there:* Serials > Add subscription fields

To add custom fields simply click the 'Add subscription fields' link on
the left of the Serial page and choose the 'New field' buttonAdd
subscription fields

The form that appears will ask for either an authorized value or a marc
field to populate the field with

Add field

For example you might want to track which department you're ordering for
or the collection code for this serialAdd department

This data will then show when you are adding a subscriptionAdd field
value

and when you view the subscriptionShow field

and when you search subscriptions (if you chose to make it
'searchable')Searchable field

`Add a subscription <#newsubscription>`__
-----------------------------------------

Subscriptions can be added by clicking the 'New' button on any
bibliographic record

New Subscription Button
|image742|

Or by visiting the Serials module and clicking 'New Subscription'

New Subscription Button
|image743|

If you are entering a new subscription from the Serials module you will
be presented with a blank form (if creating new from a bibliographic
record the form will include the bib info).

Add a new subscription (1/2)
|image744|

-  'Librarian' field will show the logged in librarian's username

-  'Vendor' can be found by either searching vendors entered via the
   `Acquisitions module <#acqmodule>`__ or entering the vendor ID number

   -  Vendor information is not required

   -  In order to claim missing and late issues you need to enter vendor
      information

      Vendor Missing Warning
      |image745|

-  'Biblio' is the MARC record you'd like to link this subscription to

   -  This can be done by searching for an existing record by clicking
      on the 'Search for Biblio' link below the boxes or by entering the
      bib number for a record in the first box. Only if you search with
      the field between the parenthesis.

-  Next you can choose whether a new item is created when receiving an
   issue (if you barcode issues you'll want to create an item at this
   time)

-  In order to determine how to handle irregularities in your
   subscription answer 'When there is an irregular issue', if the
   numbers are always sequential you'll want to pick 'Keep issue number'

-  Checking the 'Manual history' box will allow you to enter serials
   outside the prediction pattern once the subscription is saved by
   going to the 'Planning' tab on the subscription detail page.Manual
   History

-  'Call Number' is for your item's call number or call number prefix

-  'Library' is the branch that owns this subscription.

   -  If more than one library subscribes to this serial you will need
      to create a subscription for each library

   -  This can be done easily by using the 'Edit as New (Duplicate)'
      option found on the subscription information page and changing
      only the 'Library' field

      New Duplicate Subscription
      |image746|

-  Use the 'Public Note' for any notes you would like to appear in the
   OPAC for the patrons

-  'Nonpublic Note' should be used for notes that are only visible to
   the librarians via the staff client

-  The 'Patron notification' option lets you pick a notice to send to
   patrons who subscribe to updates on this serial via the OPAC.

   -  For this option to appear you need to make sure that you have a
      Routing List notice set up in the `Notices Tool <#notices>`__

-  'Location' is for the shelving location

-  The 'Grace period' is the number of days before an issue is
   automatically moved from 'Expected' status to 'Waiting' and how many
   days before an issue is automatically moved from 'Waiting' status to
   'Late'

-  The Staff and OPAC Display options allow you to control how many
   issues appear by default on bibliographic records in the Staff Client
   and the OPAC

   -  If no values are entered in these fields, they will use the
      `OPACSerialIssueDisplayCount <#OPACSerialIssueDisplayCount>`__ and
      `StaffSerialIssueDisplayCount <#StaffSerialIssueDisplayCount>`__
      system preference values

Once that data is filled in you can click 'Next' to enter the prediction
pattern information.

Add a new subscription (2/2)
|image747|

-  In 'First issue publication date' you want to enter the date of the
   issue you have in your hand, the date from which the prediction
   pattern will start

-  There are several pre-defined options for the 'Frequency' of
   publication all of which are visible alongside your own custom
   frequencies by visiting '`Manage frequencies <#serialfreq>`__'

   -  Without periodicy: some very specific (usually high level science
      journals) don't have a true periodicity. When you subscribe to the
      title, you subscribe for 6 issues, which can arrive in 1 year...
      or 2... There is no regularity or known schedule.

   -  Unknown select this if none of the other choices are relevant

   -  Irregular: The journal is not "regular" but has a periodicity. You
      know that it comes out on January, then in October and December,

-  'Subscription start date' is the date at which the subscription
   begins. This is used for setting up renewal alerts

-  'Subscription end date' should only be entered for subscriptions that
   have ended (if you're entering in a backlog of serials)

-  'Numbering pattern' will help you determine how the numbers are
   printed for each issue. Patterns entered here are saved and editable
   at any time by visiting '`Manage numbering
   patterns <#serialpatterns>`__'

   -  Start with the numbering on the issue you have in hand, the
      numbering that matches the date you entered in the 'First issue
      publication' field

   -  You can choose to create your own numbering pattern by choosing
      'None of the above' and clicking the 'Show/Hide Advanced Pattern'
      button at the bottom of the form

-  The 'Locale' option is useful when you want to display days, month or
   season. For example, if you have a German serial, you can use the
   German locale option to display days, etc. in German.

-  Once a 'Numbering pattern' is chosen the number formula will
   appear.Numbering Forumla

   -  The 'Begins with' number is the number of the issue you're holding
      in your hand.

   -  The 'Inner counter' is used to tell Koha where the "receiving
      cycle" starts

      -  For example: If the first issue to receive is "vol. 4, no. 1,
         iss. 796", you need to set up "inner counter = 0" But if it's
         "vol. 4, no. 2, iss. 797", the inner counter should be "1".

   -  After filling in this data click the 'Test prediction pattern'
      button to see what issues the system will generate, if there are
      irregularities you can choose which issues don't exist from the
      list presented.

Acquisitions
============

The Koha Acquisitions module provides a way for the library to record
orders placed with vendors and manage purchase budgets.

-  *Get there:* More > Acquisitions

`Setup <#acqsetup>`__
---------------------

Before using the Acquisitions Module you will want to make sure that you
have completed all of the set up.

First, set your `Acquisitions System Preferences <#acqprefs>`__ and
`Acquisitions Administration <#acqadmin>`__ to match your library's
workflow. Before setting your `EDI Accounts <#ediaccounts>`__ and
`Library EANs <#libraryeans>`__ you will need to have `entered your
vendors <#addacqvendor>`__.

On the main acquisitions page you will see your library's funds listed.

Acquisitions Funds Summary
|image781|

    **Note**

    If the total line is confusing for the funds you have set up you can
    hide it by adding

`Managing Suggestions <#managesuggest>`__
-----------------------------------------

Purchase suggestions can be generated in one of two ways. You can create
suggestions via the staff client either for the library or `on the
patron's behalf <#patronsuggestions>`__ from their record. Depending on
your settings in the `suggestion <#suggestionspref>`__ system
preference, patrons may also be able to make purchase suggestions via

Your suggestions will be sorted into several tabs: Accepted, Pending,
Checked, Ordered and/or Rejected. Each accepted or rejected suggestion
will show the name of the librarian who managed the suggestion and the
reason they gave for accepting or rejecting it (found under 'Status').

An 'Accepted' suggestion is one that you have marked as 'Accepted' using
the form below the suggestions. A 'Pending' suggestion is one that is
awaiting action from the library. A 'Checked' suggestion is one that has
been marked as 'Checked' using the form before the suggestions. An
'Ordered' suggestion is on that has been ordered using the '`From a
purchase suggestion <#orderfromsuggestion>`__' link in your basket. A
'Rejected' suggestion is one that you have marked at 'Rejected' using
the form below the list of suggestions.

For libraries with lots of suggestions, there are filters on the left
hand side of the Manage Suggestions page to assist in limiting the
number of titles displayed on the screen.

Suggestion Filtering
|image797|

Clicking on the blue headings will expand the filtering options and

Slips <#notices>`__ tool with the `TO\_PROCESS <#toprocessnotice>`__
notice) to the fund owner that there is a suggestion ready for them to
manage if you have turned on the `cron job to generate these
notices <#emailsuggestfund>`__.

Once you have clicked 'Submit' the suggestion will be moved to the

`Create a basket group <#acqbasketgroup>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A basket group is simply a group of baskets. In some libraries, you have
several staff members that create baskets, and, at the end of a period
of time, someone then groups them together to send to the vendor in
bulk. That said, it is possible to have one basket in a basket group if
that's the workflow used in your library.

`EDI Setup <#edisetup>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you begin ordering using EDI you will want to take the following
steps:

-  Ask your vendor/bookseller/jobber for `connection
   information <#ediquestions>`__

   -  It might also be beneficial to ask for a few sample EDIFACT files
      from the vendor

-  Share with your vendor/bookseller/jobber your `library
   codes <#libsgroups>`__, `item type codes <#itemtypeadmin>`__, `fund
   codes <#funds>`__, and any other codes or `authorized
   values <#authorizedvalues>`__ they might need for creating your MARC
   order records

-  Communicate with your support provider or the community about whether
   you will need a plugin based on your vendor's answers

   -  For example ByWater Solutions has published plugins for specific
      vendors here:
      https://github.com/bywatersolutions/koha-plugin-edifact-enhanced

-  `Enter the vendor/bookseller/jobber <#addacqvendor>`__ in
   Acquisitions

-  Review your `Acquisitions system preferences <#acqprefs>`__

   -  Be sure to fill in the `MarcFieldsToOrder <#MarcFieldsToOrder>`__
      preference with values for order files

-  Enter your `EDI Accounts <#ediaccounts>`__

-  Enter your `Library EANs <#libraryeans>`__

-  Turn on the `EDI Cron <#edicron>`__ so that it can process files

`EDI Ordering <#ediordering>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step in ordering using EDI happens on the book vendor's
website. Each seller will use different language, but you will need to
place your order on their site and then download the MARC order file.
Some language that you might see included "basket", "order", "cart",
and/or "MARC order." Once you have this MARC file downloaded to your
computer you will want to log in to Koha and continue the process there.

Visit the `Stage MARC Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__ tool and upload
your file. Once presented with the confirmation screen proceed to
Acquisitions.

In Acquisitions `create a basket <#createacqbasket>`__ for the vendor
you ordered from. From the basket, choose to `order from a staged
file <#orderfromstagedfile>`__ and click 'Order' next to the file you
downloaded from your vendor and staged in Koha.

From the confirmation screen you will see all of the data in the MARC
file related to your order. If you are not seeing fields such as fund
and quanity filled in then be sure to confirm that your
`MarcFieldsToOrder <#MarcFieldsToOrder>`__ preference is set right.

Once you have added all of the items to the basket you can click the
'Create EDIFACT order' button.

EDIFACT Order

This will generate a pending file in the `EDIFACT
Messages <#edifactmsg>`__ in Koha. The pending files will be processed
by the `EDI Cron Job <#edicron>`__ and sent to your vendor.

`EDI Invoicing <#ediinvoice>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the book vendor is done processing your files they will send an
invoice via EDI as well. The `EDI Cron Job <#edicron>`__ will grab
invoices and mark items found in the invoice as received and update your
funds without any need for manual intervention.

`EDIFACT Messages <#edifactmsg>`__
----------------------------------

A log of all messages sent and received via EDIFACT can be found under
EDIFACT Messages. EDIFACT Messages

Reports
=======

Reports in Koha are a way to gather data. Reports are used to generate
statistics, member lists, shelving lists, or any list of data in your
database.

-  *Get there:* More > Reports

`Custom Reports <#customreports>`__
-----------------------------------

Koha's data is stored in a MySQL database which means that librarians
can generate nearly any report they would like by either using the
`Guided Reports Wizard <#quidedreportwizard>`__ or writing their own
`SQL query <#reportfromsql>`__.

`Add Custom Report <#customreport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Guided Report Wizard <#quidedreportwizard>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The guided report wizard will walk you through a six step process to
generate a report.

Step 1: Choose the module you want to report on. This will determine
what tables and fields are available for you to query.

'Report is public' should be left to the default of 'No' in most cases.
A report can be made public if you intend to allow access to it through
the JSON webservice interface. This is a system that can be used by
developers to make custom presentations of the data from the report, for
example displaying it using a graphing API. To learn more speak to your
local developer.

-  A public report is accessible via a URL that looks like this:
   http://MYOPAC/cgi-bin/koha/svc/report?id=REPORTID

Chose Module for Report
|image881|

    **Note**

    If your system administrator has set up memcache on your server you
    might see one more option for the Cache expiry. This is related to
    your public reports. If you make the report public then it's
    constantly running and will cause a large load on your system.
    Setting this value prevents that.Cache expiry

Step 2: Choose a report type. For now, Tabular is the only option
available.

Report Type
|image882|

Step 3: Choose the fields you want in your report. You can select
multiple fields and add them all at once by using CTRL+Click on each
item you want to add before clicking the Add button.

Select database fields to query
|image883|

Step 4: Choose any limits you might want to apply to your report (such
as item types or branches). If you don't want to apply any limits,
simply click Next instead of making an option.

Choose limits
|image884|

Step 5: Perform math functions. If you don't want to do any
calculations, simply click Next instead of making an option.

Choose math functions
|image885|

Step 6: Choose data order. If you want the data to print out in the
order it's found in the database, simply click Finish.

Choose ordering
|image886|

When you are finished you will be presented with the SQL generated by
the report wizard. From here you can choose to save the report by
clicking 'Save' or copy the SQL and make edits to it by hand.

Custom Report Confirmation
|image887|

If you choose to save the report you will be asked to name your report,
sort it in to groups and subgroups and enter any notes regarding it.

Save custom report
|image888|

Once your report is saved it will appear on the 'Use Saved' page with
all other saved reports.

Saved Reports list
|image889|

From here you can make edits, run the report, or schedule a time to have
the report run. To find the report you created you can sort by any of
the columns by clicking the on the column header (creation date is the
best bet for finding the report you just added). You can also filter
your results using the filter menu on the left or use the tabs to find
reports based on your custom groups.

`Report from SQL <#reportfromsql>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the report wizard, you have the option to write your own
queries using SQL. To find reports written by other Koha users, visit
the Koha Wiki: http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library.
You can also find your database structure in
/installer/data/mysql/kohastructure.sql or online at:
`http://schema.koha-community.org <http://schema.koha-community.org/>`__.

To add your query, click the link to 'Create from SQL' on the main
reports module or the 'New report' button at the top of the 'Saved
reports' page.

New SQL Report
|image890|

Fill in the form presented

Create Report from SQL
|image891|

-  The 'Name' is what will appear on the Saved Reports page to help you
   identify the report later. It will also be searchable using the
   filters found the left of the Saved Reports page.

-  You can use the 'Report group' to organize your reports so that you
   can easily filter reports by groups. Report groups are set in the
   `REPORT\_GROUP <#reportgroup>`__ authorized value category or can be
   added on the fly when creating the report by choosing the 'or create'
   radio button.Report group

   -  **Note**

          If you're adding a report group on the fly, remember that you
          code should be fewer than 10 characters and should not include
          special characters or spaces.

-  You can use 'Report subgroup' to further organize your reports so
   that you can easily filter reports by groups and subgroups. Report
   subgroups are set in the `REPORT\_SUBGROUP <#reportsubgroup>`__
   authorized value category or can be added on the fly when creating
   the report by choosing the 'or create' radio button.

   Report subgroup
   |image892|

   -  **Note**

          If you're adding a report subgroup on the fly, remember that
          you code should be fewer than 10 characters and should not
          include special characters or spaces.

-  'Report is public' should be left to the default of 'No' in most
   cases. A report can be made public if you intend to allow access to
   it through the JSON webservice interface. This is a system that can
   be used by developers to make custom presentations of the data from
   the report, for example displaying it using a graphing API. To learn
   more speak to your local developer.

   -  A public report is accessible via a URL that looks like this:
      http://MYOPAC/cgi-bin/koha/svc/report?id=REPORTID

-  'Notes' will also appear on the Saved Reports page, this can be used
   to provide more details about the report or tips on how to enter
   values when it runs

-  The type should always be 'Tabular' at this time since the other
   formats have not been implemented

-  In the 'SQL' box you will type or paste the SQL for the report

-  If you feel that your report might be too resource intensive you
   might want to consider using runtime parameters to your query.
   Runtime parameters basically make a filter appear before the report
   is run to save your system resources.

   There is a specific syntax that Koha will understand as 'ask for
   values when running the report'. The syntax is <<Question to
   ask\|authorized\_value>>.

   -  The << and >> are just delimiters. You must put << at the
      beginning and >> at the end of your parameter

   -  The 'Question to ask' will be displayed on the left of the string
      to enter.

   -  The authorized\_value can be omitted if not applicable. If it
      contains an authorized value category, or branches or itemtype or
      categorycode or biblio\_framework, a list with the Koha authorized
      values will be displayed instead of a free field Note that you can
      have more than one parameter in a given SQL Note that entering
      nothing at run time won't probably work as you expect. It will be
      considered as "value empty" not as "ignore this parameter". For
      example entering nothing for : "title=<<Enter title>>" will
      display results with title='' (no title). If you want to have to
      have something not mandatory, use "title like <<Enter title>>" and
      enter a % at run time instead of nothing

   Examples:

   -  SELECT surname,firstname FROM borrowers WHERE branchcode=<<Enter
      patrons library\|branches>> AND surname like <<Enter filter for
      patron surname (% if none)>>

   -  SELECT \* FROM items WHERE homebranch = <<Pick your
      branch\|branches>> and barcode like <<Partial barcode value here>>

   -  SELECT title , author FROM biblio WHERE frameworkcode=<<Enter the
      frameworkcode\|biblio\_framework>>

       **Note**

       To generate a date picker calendar to the right of the field when
       running a report you can use the 'date' keyword like this:
       <<Enter Date\|date>>

       Date Picker
       |image893|

       **Note**

       You have to put "%" in a text box to 'leave it blank'. Otherwise,
       it literally looks for "" (empty string) as the value for the
       field.

       **Important**

       In addition to using any authorized value code to generate a
       dropdown, you can use the following values as well: Framework
       codes (biblio\_framework), Branches (branches), Item Types
       (itemtypes) and Patron Categories (categorycode). For example a
       branch pull down would be generated like this
       <<Branch\|branches>>

       Branch pull down
       |image894|

    **Note**

    There is a limit of 10,000 records put on SQL statements entered in
    Koha. To get around this you want to add 'LIMIT 100000' to the end
    of your SQL statement (or any other number above 10,000).

    **Note**

    If your system administrator has set up memcache on your server you
    might see one more option for the Cache expiry. This is related to
    your public reports. If you make the report public then it's
    constantly running and will cause a large load on your system.
    Setting this value prevents that.Cache expiry

Once everything is entered click the 'Save Report' button and you'll be
presented with options to run it. Once a report is saved you do not have
to recreate it you can simply find it on the Saved Reports page and
`run <#runcustomreport>`__ or `edit <#editcustomreports>`__ it.

`Duplicate Report <#duplicatereport>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reports can also be added by duplicating an existing report. Visit the
'Saved reports' page to see all of the reports listed on your system
already.

Saved Reports
|image895|

To the right of every report there is an 'Actions' pull down. Clickin
that and choose 'Duplicate' to use an existing report as the basis for
your new report. That will populate the new report form with the
existing SQL for easy editing and resaving.

`Edit Custom Reports <#editcustomreports>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every report can be edited from the reports lists. To see the list of
reports already stored in Koha, click 'Use Saved.'

Saved Reports
|image896|

To find the report you'd like to edit you can sort by any of the columns
by clicking the on the column header. You can also filter your results
using the filter menu on the left or use the tabs to find reports based
on your custom groups.

From this list you can edit any custom report by clicking 'Actions' to
the right of the report and choosing 'Edit' from the menu that appears.

For more on searching check the '`Searching <#searching>`__' chapter in
this manual.

`Results Overview <#opacresultsoverview>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After performing a search the number of results found for your search
will appear above the results

Total Results
|image938|

By default your search results will be sorted based on your
`OPACdefaultSortField and OPACdefaultSortOrder <#opacdefaultsort>`__
system preference values. To change this you can choose another sorting
method from the pull down on the right.

Results Sorting Options
|image939|

Under each title on your results list a series of values from your
leader will appear. It is important to note that this has nothing to do
with the item types or collection codes you have applied to your
records, this data is all pulled from your fixed fields. This can be
turned on or off with the
`DisplayOPACiconsXSLT <#DisplayOPACiconsXSLT>`__ system preference.

Leader Visualization
|image940|

Below each title you will see the availability for the items attached to
the record.

    **Note**

    Even if you filtered on one library location all locations that hold
    the item will appear on the search results.

    **Important**

    An item's hold status doesn't not affect whether or not the item is
    'available' until the item is in 'waiting' status. Items with
    on-shelf holds will show as available until a librarian has pulled
    them from the shelf and checked the item in make it show 'waiting'.

|image964|

`Lists & Cart <#opaclistscart>`__
---------------------------------

A cart is a temporary holding place for records you're interested in
finding during this session. That means that once you log out of the
OPAC or close the browser you lose the items in your cart. A list is a
more permanent location for saving items. To learn more about lists,
check the `Lists in the Staff Client <#stafflists>`__ chapter of this
manual.

`Lists <#opaclists>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patrons can manage their own private lists by visiting the 'my lists'
section of their account.

Lists Management
|image965|

`Creating Lists <#opacaddlists>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lists can also be created by choosing the 'New List' option in the 'Add
to' menu on the search results

Add to New List
|image966|

To create a list the patron simply needs to click the 'New List' link
and populate the form that appears

Create a new list
|image967|

The only field required is the 'List Name,' but the patron can also
choose how they want the list sorted and if the list is public or
private.

-  A Private List is managed by you and can be seen only by you
   (depending on your permissions settings below)

-  A Public List can be seen by everybody, but managed only by you
   (depending on your permissions settings below)

    **Important**

    If you aren't allowing patrons to create public lists with the
    `OpacAllowPublicListCreation <#OpacAllowPublicListCreation>`__
    preference then patrons will only be able to create private lists.

    Create a new private list
    |image968|

-  Finally decide what your permissions will be on the list. You can all
   or disallow:

   -  anyone else to add entries

   -  anyone to remove his own contributed entries

      -  **Note**

-  If allowed by your
   `OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture <#OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture>`__
   preference, the 'Hold Starts on Date' column will show. This field
   allows the patron to have their hold start on a future date.

-  By default holds placed in the system remain until canceled, but if
   the patron fills in a 'Hold Not Needed After' date then the hold has
   an expiration date.

   -  **Important**

          Expired holds are removed by the `Expired Holds Cron
          Job <#expiredholdscron>`__, this is not an automatic process

`reviewson <#reviewson>`__ preference set to allow this. Each
bibliographic record has a comments tab below the bibliographic
information.

Pending Comment
|image993|

Once the comment is approved the patron will see the number of comments
on the 'Comments' tab and their comment labeled amongst the other
comments. If you have set your
`ShowReviewerPhoto <#ShowReviewerPhoto>`__ preference to 'Show' then
you'll see the patron's photo pulled from the
`Libravatar <https://www.libravatar.org>`__ library.

Your Comments
|image994|

Other patrons will see the comment with the name of the patron who left
the comment (unless you have set the `ShowReviewer <#ShowReviewer>`__
preference to not show patron names).

Comment by other patron
|image995|

If you have your `OpacShowRecentComments <#OpacShowRecentComments>`__
set to show then you'll see the approved comments on that page.

installed, you will see a folder icon in the address bar to the right of
the URL. Clicking that folder will open up a list of titles on the page
for you to pick from to add to Zotero.

|image998|

`Custom RSS Feeds <#customrss>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using misc/cronjobs/rss/rss.pl you can generate an RSS feed for any SQL
query (for example a new acquisitions RSS feed). rss.pl is run on the
command line to produce an RSS XML document.

The output should be placed in a directory accessible to the OPAC (or
staff) web interface so that users can download the RSS feed.

An example of usage can be found at: misc/cronjobs/rss.pl
lastAcquired.conf

Normally rss.pl should be run periodically (e.g., daily) to keep the
feed up-to-date.

The configuration file (e.g., lastAcquired.conf) lists

-  name of the template file to use

-  path of output file

-  SQL query

rss.pl runs the SQL query, then feeds the output of the query through
the template to produce the output file.

    **Important**

    To use custom RSS feeds you need to turn on the rss.pl cron job.

`OPAC Self Registration <#selfregistration>`__
----------------------------------------------

If you allow it, patrons can register for their own accounts via the
OPAC. If you have the
`PatronSelfRegistration <#PatronSelfRegistration>`__ preference set to
'Allow' then patrons will see a link to register below the log in box on
the right of the main OPAC page.

Registration link in OPAC
|image999|

When the patron clicks the 'Register here' link they will be brough to a
registration page. The options on the registration page can be conrolled
by editing the
`PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerMandatoryField <#PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerMandatoryField>`__
and the
`PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerUnwantedField <#PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerUnwantedField>`__
preferences.

Registration form
|image1000|

Once the patron has confirmed submitted their registration they will
either be sent an email to confirm their account (if you have the
`PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail <#PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail>`__
preference to require this) or presented with their new username and
password.

New account confirmation
|image1001|

Patrons registered in this way will not have a cardnumber until assigned
one by the library, but will have access to all OPAC functionality
immediately. For this reason it is recommended that you:

-  set up a provisional `patron category <#addingpatroncat>`__ for self
   registered patrons (such as 'Self Registered) instead of using an
   existing patron category and set that value in the
   `PatronSelfRegistrationDefaultCategory <#PatronSelfRegistrationDefaultCategory>`__
   preference

-  give this patron category minimal circulation privileges in the
   `Circulation and Fine Rules <#circfinerules>`__ (such as allowing a
   couple holds, but no check outs)

That way patrons will either have to come in to the library to verify
their identity before given a cardnumber and the ability to check items
out or the library will have to come up with internal policy on
generating cardnumbers before providing them to self registered patrons.
Once this is done the library can change the category to one that is
more appropriate (be it an adult, resident, non resident, student, etc)
and add a cardnumber/barcode.

`My Account <#opacmyaccount>`__
-------------------------------

From the OPAC patrons can log in and access their account if you have
set the `opacuserlogin <#opacuserlogin>`__ preference to 'Allow'. Once
logged in patrons are brought to their account summary. If you would
like to get to your account in the OPAC, you can click on your name in
the top right of any page in the OPAC.

`Resetting your password <#resetpwopac>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the `OpacResetPassword <#OpacResetPassword>`__ set to allow
patrons to reset their password they can click 'Forgot your password?'
link found under the log in box to reset their passwords.

'Forgot your password?' link
|image1002|

Once clicked they will be presented with a form asking for their
username and their email address (patrons must have an email address on
file to reset their password).Recover password

The system will then email the patron instructions for resetting their
password.Reset password confirmation

`My Summary <#opacmysummary>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My Summary
|image1003|

From the 'my summary' tab, patrons will see all of the items they have
checked out with the overdue items highlighted in red. If you have
`OpacRenewalAllowed <#OpacRenewalAllowed>`__ set to 'Allow' then your
patrons will be able to renew their books right from the OPAC. If you
have HTML entered in the `OPACMySummaryHTML <#OPACMySummaryHTML>`__
preference then you will see that to the right of the 'Fines' column.

Checked out tab with OPACMySummaryHTML set
|image1004|

If your patrons would like to see the items barcodes on their list of
checked out items you can set up a `patron
attribute <#patronattributetypes>`__ with the value of SHOW\_BCODE and
`authorized value <#authorizedvalues>`__ of YES\_NO.

Add SHOW\_BCODE patron attribute
|image1005|

Then on the `patron's record set the value <#editpatrons>`__ for
SHOW\_BCODE to yes.

Setting value for SHOW\_BCODE on patron record
|image1006|

This will add a column to the check out summary in the OPAC that shows
the patrons the barcodes of the items they have checked out.

`Guide to Searching <#searchguide>`__
-------------------------------------

This brief guide will explain a chart that shows a sample of how a
MARC21 database can be configured, as well as a brief introductory
searching guide. The indexing fields described in this document relate
to the bibliographic data and does not address authority database
indexing.

`Indexing and Searching Description <#searchguide-indexing>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Koha's databases are indexed by the Zebra open-source software. The
overview to the documentation describes Zebra as:

    "...Zebra is a high-performance, general-purpose structured text
    indexing and retrieval engine. It reads records in a variety of
    input formats (eg. email, XML, MARC) and provides access to them
    through a powerful combination of Boolean search expressions and
    relevance-ranked free-text queries.

    Zebra supports large databases (tens of millions of records, tens of
    gigabytes of data). It allows safe, incremental database updates on
    live systems. Because Zebra supports the industry-standard
    information retrieval protocol, Z39.50, you can search Zebra
    databases using an enormous variety of programs and toolkits, both
    commercial and free, which understands this protocol..." Zebra -
    User's Guide and Reference, p. 1,
    http://www.indexdata.dk/zebra/doc/zebra.pdf

This brief guide will explain a chart that shows a sample of how a
MARC21 database can be configured, as well as a brief introductory
searching guide. The indexing fields described in this document relate
to the bibliographic data and does not address authority database
indexing.

    **Note**

    The indexing described in this document is the set used by
    SouthEastern University. Your local indexing may vary.

`Indexing Configuration <#searchguide-indexconfig>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three configuration files that Koha uses while indexing.

The first configuration file (etc/zebradb/biblios/etc/bib1.att) contains
the Z39.50 bib-1 attribute list, plus the Koha local use attributes for
Biblio Indexes, Items Index, and Fixed Fields and other special indexes.
The Z39.50 Bib-1 profile is made up of several different types of
attributes: Use, Relation, Position, Structure, Truncation, and
Completeness. The bib-1 'Use' attribute is represented on the chart; the
other attributes are used primarily when doing searches. While there are
over 150+ use attributes that could be used to define your indexing set,
it's unlikely that you will choose to use them all. The attributes you
elect to use are those that become the indexing rules for your database.
The other five attribute sets define the various ways that a search can
be further defined, and will not specifically be addressed in this
document. For a complete list of the standard Bib-1 attributes, go to
http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html.

The second file is
etc/zebradb/marc\_defs/[marc21\|unimarc]/biblios/record.abs if you use
grs1 indexing [the default until 3.16] or
etc/zebradb/marc\_defs/[marc21\|unimarc]/biblios/biblio-koha-indexdefs.xml
if you use dom indexing [the default from 3.18]. Either files contains
the abstract syntax which maps the MARC21 tags to the set of Use
Attributes you choose to use. To be more precise the xml file to be
activate needs to be transform into biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl, read the
head of biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl to know more about this topic. The
rules established in this file provides a passable Bath level 0 and 1
service, which includes author, title, subject, keyword and exact
services such as standard identifiers (LCCN, ISBN, ISSN, etc.)

The third file (etc/zebradb/ccl.properties) is the Common Command
Language (CCL) field mappings. This file combines the bib-1 attribute
set file and the abstract file and adds the qualifiers, usually known as
index names. The qualifiers, or indexes, for this database are: pn, cpn,
cfn, ti, se, ut, nb, ns, sn, lcn, callnum, su, su-to, su-geo, su-ut,
yr,pubdate, acqdate, ln, pl, ab, nt, rtype, mc-rtype, mus, au, su-na,
kw, pb, ctype, and an.

The `Koha Indexing Chart <#kohasearchindexes>`__ summarizes the contents
of all three of these files in a more readable format. The first two
columns labeled Z39.50 attribute and Z39.50 name matches the Z39.50
bib-1 attributes file. The third column labeled MARC tags indexed is
where you find which MARC tags are mapped to an attribute. The fourth
column labeled Qualifiers identifies the search abbreviations used in
the internal CCL query. The following description provides a definition
for the word 'qualifiers'.

*Qualifiers are used to direct the search to a particular searchable
index, such as title (ti) and author indexes (au). The CCL standard
itself doesn't specify a particular set of qualifiers, but it does
suggest a few shorthand notations. You can customize the CCL parser to
support a particular set of qualifiers to reflect the current target
profile. Traditionally, a qualifier would map to a particular
use-attribute within the BIB-1attribute set. It is also possible to set
other attributes, such as the structure attribute.*

In the MARC tags indexed column, there are some conventions used that
have specific meanings. They are:

-  A three digit tag (100) means that all subfields in the tag can be
   used in a search query. So, if you enter a search for 'Jackson' as an
   author, you will retrieve records where Jackson could be the last
   name or the first name.

-  A three digit tag that has a '$' followed by a letter (600$a) means
   that a search query will only search the 'a' subfield.

-  A three digit tag that is followed by a ':' and a letter (240:w)
   means that a search query can be further qualified. The letter
   following the ':' identifies how to conduct the search. The most
   common values you'll see are 'w' (word), 'p' (phrase), 's' (sort),
   and 'n' (numeric).

The contents of the MARC tags, subfields, and/or fixed field elements
that are listed in this chart are all indexed. You'll see that every
attribute line is not mapped to a specific qualifier (index)-LC card
number, line 9 is one example. However, every indexed word (a string of
characters preceded and succeeded by a space) can be searched using a
keyword (kw) search. So, although an LC card number specific index
doesn't exist, you can still search by the LCCN since tag 010 is
assigned to the LC-card-number attribute. To verify this, enter 72180055
in the persistent search box. You should retrieve The gods themselves,
by Isaac Asimov.

Examples of fixed field elements indexing can be seen on the chart
between Attribute 8822 and Attribute 8703. These attributes are most
commonly used for limiting. The fixed field attributes currently
represent the BK codes. Other format codes, if needed, could be defined.

`Basic Searching <#searchguide-basics>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The search box that library staff and library patrons will see most
often is the persistent search box at the top of the page. Koha
interprets the searches as keyword searches.

Koha search box
|image1037|

To start a search, you enter a word or multiple words in the search box.
When a single word is entered, a keyword search is performed. You can
check this out by typing one word into the form and note the number of
results located. Then, repeat the search with a minor change. In front
of the search word, type 'kw=' followed by the same search term. The
results will be identical.

When you have more than one word in the search box, Koha will still do a
keyword search, but a bit differently. Each word will be searched on its
own, then the Boolean connector 'and' will narrow your search to those
items with all words contained in matching records.

Suppose you want to find material about how libraries are using mashups.
You'll select the major words and enter them into the persistent search
box.

Keyword Search
|image1038|

The response to this search is:

Results
|image1039|

The order of the words does not affect the retrieval results, so you
could also enter the search as "mashups library". The response to this
search is results

Results
|image1040|

Too many words in the search box will find very few matches, as the
following example illustrates:

No results found
|image1041|

`Advanced Searching <#searchguide-advanced>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you can't find the most appropriate material with a general search,
you can move to the Advanced Search page by clicking on the Search
option on the persistent toolbar.

Koha Menu
|image1042|

The Advanced Search page offers many ways to limit the results of your
search. You can search using the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT;
limit by item type; limit by year and language; limit by subtypes
audience, content, format, or additional content types; by location and
by availability.

The first limiting section on the Advanced Search page provides a quick
and simple way to use the Boolean operators in your search. Note that
this display depends on a system preference setting. This option can be
found on the Administration > System Preferences > Searching page. The
option called `expandedSearchOption <#expandedSearchOption>`__ must be
set to 'show' to see the following display.

Advanced Search Options
|image1043|

In this section you can choose among the many indexes by clicking on the
arrow in the first box. The blank box that follows is where you enter
your first search term or terms. On the second line, you can choose the
Boolean operator you want to use in your search. The options are 'and',
'or', and 'not'. Then, you would again choose the index to search,
followed by the second term or terms. If you have more concepts you want
to include in your search, you can click the [+] to add another line for
your search.

A sample search is shown next, followed by its results:

Advanced Search
|image1044|

Results from Advanced Search
|image1045|

When you use the Boolean operators to broaden or narrow a search,
remember the action of each operator. The 'and' operator narrows the
results you'll retrieve because the search will retrieve the records
that include all your search terms. The 'or' operator expands the
results because the search will look for occurrences of all of your
search terms. The 'not' operator excludes records with the term that
follows the operator.

Note: If you leave this `expandedSearchOption <#expandedSearchOption>`__
set to 'don't show', this is the display you will see:

Fewer Search Options
|image1046|

The Advanced Search page then shows the multiple kinds of limits that
can be applied to your search results. Either check a box or select from
the drop down menus to narrow your search. You will type the year, year
range, or a 'greater than (>)' or 'less than (<)' year.

Other Advanced Search Options
|image1047|

Finally, you can choose how the results will be sorted. The pre-defined
sort options are in the final area of the Advanced Search screen.

Sort Results By
|image1048|

The default sort is by relevance, although you can choose to sort by
author, by title, by call number, by dates, or by popularity (which uses
the information on total issues found in the items table). If you would
prefer a different default sort, you can set
`defaultSortField <#defaultSortField>`__ to one of the other choices in
Administration > System Preferences > Searching.

`Item Searching <#searchguide-itemsearch>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are looking for specific items you can use the item search engine
in the staff client to find them.

-  *Get there:* Search > Go to item search

At the top of the advanced search page in the staff client you will see
a link to 'Go to item search'Item search link

Clicking that link will open up a item specific search engine.Item
search

Using the search form that is presented you can find a list of specific
items that can be output to the screen or to a CSV file. If your results
are printed to the screen you will have the option to narrow your search
further using filters at the top.Item search results

`Common Command Language Searching <#searchguide-ccl>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Koha uses the Common Command Language (CCL) (ISO 8777) as its internal
search protocol. Searches initiated in the graphical interface use this
protocol as well, although the searcher doesn't know which indexes,
operators and limiters are available and being used to conduct their
search. The searcher can use the Advanced Search when more precise
results set are desired and where the search indexes are somewhat known.
However, some library users and many library staff prefer using a
command based structure. This part of the document will present and
explain the use of the Koha command based structure. The indexes,
operators, and limiters used are identical to those used in the
graphical interface.

`Indexes <#searchguide-indexes>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CCL standard itself doesn't specify a particular set of qualifiers
(indexes), but it does suggest a few short-hand notations such as 'ti',
'au', and 'su'. Koha has a default set of indexes; it's possible to
customize that set by adding needed indexes based on local requirements.
A qualifier (index) maps to a particular use-attribute within the Z39.50
BIB-1 attribute set. The complete Z39.50 Bib-1 Attribute can be viewed
at http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html.

The standard Koha set of indexes is a fairly common example of MARC21
indexing rules. The indexes that are defined in Koha are indexes
typically used by other integrated library systems. The defined Z39.50
Bib-1 Attribute mapped to the indexes include:

+--------------------------------+----------------------------+

`Search Syntax <#searchguide-syntax>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the persistent search box, single words generally retrieve large
sets. To narrow a search, you can use multiple words. Koha automatically
uses the 'and' Boolean operator to create a set of records matching your
input. When you want to narrow the search to an author or a title or a
subject or some other specific field or use a Boolean operator, there
isn't an obvious way to accomplish that specificity. The library user
can, of course, go to the Advanced Search page; however, if you know how
to construct a CCL search, you can achieve more specificity while using
the persistent search box on any page.

There is a specific order to the CCL search syntax. Although it can be
used for simple searches, it is an especially effective way to perform
complex searches, as it affords you a great deal of control over your
search results. To construct a CCL search, first enter a desired index
code, then an equal sign, followed by your search word(s). Following are
examples of simple CCL searches.

-  ti=principles of accounting

-  au=brown joseph

-  su=poetry

-  su-na=Shakespeare

-  kw=marlin

You can refine your search by combining search terms with Boolean
operators 'and', 'or', or 'not'. Following are examples of searches
using Boolean operators.

-  ti=principles of accounting and au=brown joseph

-  su=poetry not su-na=Shakespeare

-  kw=communication and su=debate

You can also choose to search for things that start with a character or
series of characters

-  ti,first-in-subfield=C (will show you all titles that start with the
   letter 'C')

Other string location searches can be performed with the following
keywords:

-  rtrn : right truncation

-  ltrn : left truncation

-  lrtrn : left and right truncation

-  st-date : type date

-  st-numeric : type number (integer)

-  ext : exact search on whole subfield (does not work with icu)

-  phr : search on phrase anywhere in the subfield

-  startswithnt : subfield starts with

Using specific indexes and Boolean operators are not the only way a
search can be refined. You can also refine your search as a phrase when
looking for a title, author, or subject. The syntax for this search is
*index,phr=search words*.

To illustrate the results of various search types, a search was done for
the words 'supreme court'. The results illustrate that the search index
and the word order make a difference in search results. Only the results
count and the search itself is in these examples. The search executed
will always be between the single quotes.

|image1057|

You can also choose to use limiters in your search query. Some common
limiters include dates, languages, record types, and item types. In the
Advance Search, you can either click a box or key in data to limit your
search. You can also apply the same limits with CCL by using the syntax
in the following examples. In all

*By Date: su=supreme court and yr,st-numeric=>2000*

Sample Search 10
|image1058|

When you limit by date, you can use the '>' (greater than), '<' (less
than), '=' (equal), or 'yyyy-yyyy' (range) symbols.

*By Item Type: su=nursing and itype:BK*

Sample Search 11
|image1059|

Each library will have a different set of item types defined in their
circulation configuration. When you set up item types, you define a code
and a name for each one. The name will appear on the Advance Search
page. The code you assigned is used as a CCL search limit, formatted as
'itype:x', where 'x' is the assigned code. The initial set of item types
in Koha will usually be edited to reflect your collections, so your item
type limiters may be different than the initial ones. The initial item
type limiters follow.

-  itype:BKS Books, Booklets, Workbooks

-  itype:SR Audio Cassettes, CDs

-  itype:IR Binders

-  itype:CF CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, General Online Resources

-  itype:VR DVDs, VHS

-  itype:KT Kit

-  itype:AR Models

-  itype:SER Serials

*By format: su=supreme court not l-format:sr*

Sample Search 12
|image1060|

The format limiters are derived from a combination of LDR, 006 and 007
positions. The formats that are currently defined are the following.

-  l-format:ta Regular print

-  l-format:tb Large print

-  l-format:fk Braille

-  l-format:sd CD audio

-  l-format:ss Cassette recording

-  l-format:vf VHS tape

-  l-format:vd DVD video

-  l-format:co CD software

-  l-format:cr Website

*By content type: su=supreme court not ctype:l*

Sample Search 13
|image1061|

The content types are taken from the 008 MARC tag, positions 24-27.

There are two other limiter types that are not described in this
document. They are: Audience and Content. The only difference in the
syntax of the CCL is the actual limiter. They are reproduced here just
in case you would like to use these limiters.

`Koha Search Indexes <#kohasearchindexes>`__

By default, not all fields are indexed in the Zebra search engine, but
many are. Below are the MARC21 fields that are indexed in Zebra.

Table: Indexes

Plugin System
=============

Koha's Plugin System allows for you to add additional tools and reports
to Koha that are specific to your library. Plugins are installed by
uploading KPZ ( Koha Plugin Zip ) packages. A KPZ file is just a zip
file containing the perl files, template files, and any other files
necessary to make the plugin work.

The plugin system needs to be turned on by a system administrator.

`Set up <#pluginsetup>`__
-------------------------

To set up the Koha plugin system you must first make some changes to
your install.

-  Change <enable\_plugins>0</enable\_plugins> to
   <enable\_plugins>1</enable\_plugins> in your koha-conf.xml file

-  Restart your webserver

Once set up is complete you will need to alter your
`UseKohaPlugins <#UseKohaPlugins>`__ system preference. On the Tools
page you will see the Tools Plugins and on the Reports page you will see
the Reports Plugins.

Search History
==============

If you have your `EnableSearchHistory <#EnableSearchHistory>`__
preference set to keep your search history then you can access this
information by clicking on your username in the top right of the staff
client and choosing 'Search history'.

Search history
|image1062|

From this page you will see your bibliographic search history

Bibliographic search history
|image1063|

And your authority search history.

About Koha
==========

The 'About Koha' area will give you important server information as well
as general information about Koha.

-  *Get there:* More > About Koha

`Server Information <#aboutserver>`__
-------------------------------------

Under the 'Server Information' tab you will find information about the
Koha version and the machine you have installed Koha on. This
information is very important for debugging problems. When reporting
issues to your support provider or to the various other support avenues
(mailing lists, chat room, etc), it's always good to give the
information from this screen.

Server Information on Koha
|image1065|

`Perl Modules <#aboutserverperl>`__
-----------------------------------

In order to take advantage of all of the functionalities of Koha, you
will need to keep your Perl modules up to date. The 'Perl Modules' tab
will show you all of the modules required by Koha, the version you have
installed and whether you need to upgrade certain modules.

Perl Modules
|image1066|

Items listed in bold are required by Koha, items highlighed in red are
missing completely and items highlighted in yellow simply need to be
upgraded.

`System Information <#aboutsystem>`__
-------------------------------------

This tab will provide you with warnings if you are using system
preferences that have since been deprecated or system preferences that
you have set without other required preferences

Implementation Checklist
========================

The following guide will walk you through the areas of Koha you need to
look at in order to prepare to start using the system.

`Data Migration <#imp-migration>`__
-----------------------------------

Before you can start using Koha you'll need to have some data. This can
be done by entering it all by hand, but most people already have their
data in electronic format of some sort and just need to reformat it a
bit for importing into Koha.

-  Create a list of libraries and enter their info and codes into
   `Libraries & Groups <#libsgroups>`__

-  Define your list of `Item Types <#itemtypeadmin>`__

-  Define your patron categories and enter the categories and their
   codes into `Patron Categories <#patcats>`__

-  Enter any additional patron information fields you use in your
   library in the `Patron Attributes <#patronattributetypes>`__

   -  Requires that you first set the
      `ExtendedPatronAttributes <#ExtendedPatronAttributes>`__ system
      preference if you have custom fields

-  Define all of your `Authorized Values <#authorizedvalues>`__

   -  `Collection codes <#ccode>`__

   -  `Shelving locations <#shelvelocvals>`__

   -  Item statuses (`lost <#lost>`__, `not for loan <#notforloan>`__,
      `damaged <#damageauth>`__, `withdrawn <#withdrawnauth>`__)

   -  Plus any others that are needed in your library

-  Optionally define `City/State/Postal Code <#citytowns>`__ combos

-  `Map your bibliographic data <#kohamarcmapping>`__ from your legacy
   system to Koha fields and migrate (remembering to use the collection,
   shelving, item type and library codes you entered in the above
   setting areas)

-  `Map your patron data <#patronimport>`__ from your legacy system to
   the Koha fields and migrate (remembering to use the patron and
   library codes you defined above)

-  Test your migrated data to be sure that everything is as you expect
   it to be, some things to test include:

   -  Check some of your titles with diacritics and make sure that they
      migrated properly.

   -  Check titles in a series and make sure that series information
      migrated properly.

   -  Make sure that your patrons have their contact information in the
      right fields.

   -  If your serials data was migrated search for these records in the
      catalog and confirm that they look right.

   -  If your serials data was migrated search for these records in the
      serials module and confirm that they look right.

   -  Check marc records to verify a variety of items are cataloged
      correctly

   -  Check cataloging process to see if all necessary fields are
      available

   -  If fines are migrated, check to see that they are applied
      correctly

   -  If holds are migrated, check to see they are accurate in catalog
      and patron record

`Admin Configuration <#impadmin>`__
-----------------------------------

Most of these preferences won't need to be changed to use your Koha

   -  Decide when the system `checks URLs in catalog
      records <#checkurlcron>`__ to see if they are still valid

`Authorities Configuration <#impauthorities>`__
-----------------------------------------------

Koha has the ability to keep track of your authority records and how
they're linked to your bibliographic records. Before using authorities
you should configure several preferences.

-  Set `Authority Frameworks <#authoritiesadmin>`__ aka templates

-  Authority System Preferences

   -  `BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__ : Decide if
      Koha creates authorities when cataloging

   -  `dontmerge <#dontmerge>`__ : Decide if updates to authorities
      trigger updates to the bibliographic records that link to them

   -  `AutoCreateAuthorities <#AutoCreateAuthorities>`__ : Decide when
      authorities are created

   -  `LinkerModule <#LinkerModule>`__ : Decide which match the
      authority linker should use

      linking to be broader or more specific

   -  `CatalogModuleRelink <#CatalogModuleRelink>`__ : Decide if you
      want to enable authority linking while cataloging

-  Set up your `cron jobs <#cronjobs>`__

   -  Choose when the system looks for authorities updates to `merge
      changes into bibliographic records <#mergeauthcron>`__

`Searching Configuration <#impsearching>`__
-------------------------------------------

There are several system preferences related to searching, it is not
always recommended to make too many changes to these preferences since
they are set to get you the most relevant results. If you would like to
change the default way that Koha handles searching, view the `Searching
system preferences <#searchingprefs>`__ tab.

-  Set up your `cron jobs <#cronjobs>`__

   -  Decide how often your `system rebuilds the search
      index <#rebuildsearchcron>`__ (4-10 min)

SOPAC2 Installation
===================

`Introduction <#sopacintro>`__
------------------------------

This is an installation guide for SOPAC2 and its Koha connector. It has
been tested on Debian Lenny and Ubuntu Jaunty with Drupal 6.12 and Koha
3.0.x. It does not cover the installation of Koha and Drupal, only
SOPAC, its dependencies and the connector.

`Installation of Locum and Insurge <#sopacinstall>`__
-----------------------------------------------------

Locum and Insurge are the two libraries used primarily by SOPAC. They
serve as a layer of abstraction to the data. Insurge manages the social
aspect (tags, reviews, ratings), while Locum manages the connection to
the ILS via the connector. Both libraries use a different database from
that of Drupal.

`Dependencies <#sopacdepend>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no packages for Debian MDB2 yet, you can install it via pear:

::

    # apt-get install php-pear
    # pear install MDB2
    # pear install MDB2#mysql

`Download <#sopacdownload>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the Locum and Insurge libraries from SVN:

::

    # cd /usr/local/lib
    # svn co http://dobby.darienlibrary.org/svn/locum/trunk/ locum
    # svn co http://dobby.darienlibrary.org/svn/insurge/trunk/ insurge

`Creation of the Database <#sopaccreatedb>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ mysql -u root
    mysql> create database scas;
    mysql> grant all privileges on scas.* to scas_user@'localhost' identified by 'scas_pass';
    mysql> flush privileges;
    mysql> exit

`Sync DSN <#sopacdsn>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file will provide the connection information to a DB libraries:

::

    # nano /usr/local/etc/locum_insurge_dsn.php

It should contain:

::

    <?php
    $dsn = 'mysql://scas_user:scas_pass@localhost/scas';

`Installation of Insurge <#sopacinstallinsurge>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you customize the name of the database, remember to edit the sql
file:

::

    # nano /usr/local/lib/insurge/sql/scas_insurge.sql

Import Insurge:

::

    $ mysql -u root -p < /usr/local/lib/insurge/sql/scas_insurge.sql

Configure Insurge:

::

    # nano /usr/local/lib/insurge/config/insurge.ini

The variables in insurge.ini are empty. The default values are too long
and cause MySQL errors.

Here is a sample of insurge.ini

::

    ; This is the Locum configuration file
    ; General configuration options for your installation of Insurge.
    [insurge_config]
    dsn_file = "/usr/local/etc/locum_insurge_dsn.php"
    ; This is where you configure your repository membership information.
    ;
    ; parent_server is the server name of the repository parent server you have been
    ; told to use.
    ; group_id = The group ID you have been given by your repository admin.
    ; These configuration points are OPTIONAL and are only necessary if you are
    ; participating in a repository relationship.
    [repository_info]
    parent_server = ""
    group_id = ""
    group_key = ""

`Installation of Locum <#sopacinstallocum>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same procedure applies to Locum

::

    # nano /usr/local/lib/locum/sql/scas_locum.sql
    # mysql < /usr/local/lib/locum/sql/scas_locum.sql
    # nano /usr/local/lib/locum/sql/locum_init.sql
    # mysql < /usr/local/lib/locum/sql/locum_init.sql
    # nano /usr/local/lib/locum/config/locum.ini
    # mkdir /usr/local/var
    # mkdir /usr/local/var/log

Configure the DSN:

::

    [locum_config]
    dsn_file = "/usr/local/etc/locum_insurge_dsn.php"

And the information for your Koha installation:

::

    [ils_config]
    ils = "koha";
    ils_version = "30x"
    ils_server = "localhost"
    ils_harvest_port = "80"

The rest depends on your Koha configuration.

`Installation of Koha Connector <#sopackoha>`__
-----------------------------------------------

Download the Koha connector using SVN:

::

    # cd /usr/local/lib/locum/connectors/
    # svn co http://dobby.darienlibrary.org/svn/connectors/koha/ locum_koha_30x

`Harvest Records <#sopacharvest>`__
-----------------------------------

Now that the connector is in place, we will be able to launch
harvest.php, a tool that will reap Locum DB Koha and fill the locum.

Start by configuring harvest.php:

::

    # nano /usr/local/lib/locum/tools/harvest.php

Here are the variables you must change:

::

    $first_record = 1;
    $last_record = 30;

These are the minimum and maximum biblionumbers from your Koha install.

Then start the harvest:

::

    # chmod +x /usr/local/lib/locum/tools/harvest.php
    $ /usr/local/lib/locum/tools/harvest.php

`Installation of Sphinx <#sopacphinx>`__
----------------------------------------

Sphinx is the indexer for the database used by Locum and Insurge.

`Dependencies <#sphinxdepend>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no Debian package for Sphinx so you'll have to compile the
source directly:

::

    # apt-get install g++ make libmysql++-dev

`Download and Compile <#sphinxdownload>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ wget http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads/sphinx-0.9.8.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf sphinx-0.9.8.tar.gz
    $ cd sphinx-0.9.8
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/sphinx
    $ make
    # make install
    # mkdir /usr/local/sphinx
    # mkdir /usr/local/sphinx/lib
    # cp api/sphinxapi.php /usr/local/sphinx/lib/
    $ rm -R sphinx-0.9.8*

`Creation of User and Group <#sphinxuser>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a Sphinx user and change the owner:

::

    # adduser sphinx
    # addgroup sphinx
    # usermod -G sphinx sphinx
    # mkdir /usr/local/sphinx/var/run
    # chown -R sphinx.sphinx /usr/local/sphinx/var

`The Sphinx daemon <#demonsphinx>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download:

::

    # cd /etc/init.d
    # wget http://www.thesocialopac.net/sites/thesocialopac.net/files/sphinx
    # chmod +x /etc/init.d/sphinx

Add Sphinx to the default boot services:

::

    # update-rc.d sphinx defaults

`Configuration <#sphinxconfig>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the configuration file supplied with the source of Sphinx before
the change:

::

    # cp /usr/local/lib/locum/sphinx/sphinx.conf /usr/local/sphinx/etc/
    # sed 's/locum_db_user/scas_user/g' /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf > tmpfile;
    mv tmpfile /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf
    # sed 's/locum_db_pass/scas_pass/g' /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf > tmpfile; mv tmpfile /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf

And if you personalize the name of the database:

::

    # sed 's/scas/MY_DB/g' /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf > tmpfile; mv tmpfile /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf

`Indexing documents <#sphinxindexing>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indexing is necessary if you want to use the search features of SOPAC.

You must first complete the Insurge table index

::

    # chmod +x /usr/local/lib/insurge/tools/update-index.php
    $ /usr/local/lib/insurge/tools/update-index.php

Then start indexing Sphinx

::

    $ /usr/local/sphinx/bin/indexer --all

Finally, we must start the daemon:

::

    # /etc/init.d/sphinx start

When the daemon is running, you can update the index with:

::

    $ /usr/local/sphinx/bin/indexer --all --rotate

`Installation of SOPAC2 <#installsopac>`__
------------------------------------------

Now to the SOPAC software itself:

`Download <#downloadsopac>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download from SVN:

::

    $ cd /chemin/vers/drupal/sites/all/
    $ mkdir modules
    $ cd modules/
    $ svn co http://dobby.darienlibrary.org/svn/sopac/trunk/ sopac

`Installation <#sopacinstallation>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Drupal's administration settings, activate the module. Also, enable
the dependencies:

-  Profile

-  PHP Filter

-  Path

The Drupal menu should now list these entries.

`Configuration <#configsopac>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then go into the settings of SOPAC.

-  Configure the paths to the Locum and Insurge libraries

-  Choose a URL prefix SOPAC, in my "catalog". Create a node with
   content like:

::

    <?php
    print sopac_search_form('both');
    print theme('pages_catalog');

-  Check the Input Format "PHP Code"

-  Check Move to front page

-  In URL path settings, set the SOPAC URL prefix you have chosen.

Go to the root of Drupal, a search form will appear.

Remember to empty Drupal's cache when something does not work.

Drupal offers a few blocks, which are not configured by default. You
must specify on which page they should appear.

Cron Jobs
=========

A cron job is a Linux command for scheduling a command or script on your
server to complete repetitive tasks automatically. Scripts executed as a
cron job are typically used to modify files or databases; however, they
can perform other tasks that do not modify data on the server, like
sending out email notifications. Koha has many cron jobs in place that
you can enable (search engine indexing, overdue notice generation, data
cleanup and more), this chapter will explain those for you.

`Cron Jobs <#cronjobs>`__
-------------------------

The locations below assume a dev install which puts the crons in misc/,
if you have a standard install you may want to look in bin/ for these
files if you cannot find them in misc/

`Search <#searchcron>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Rebuild Index <#rebuildsearchcron>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script path: misc/migration\_tools/rebuild\_zebra.pl

Does: Updates Zebra indexes with recently changed data.

Required by: Zebra

Frequency suggestion: every x minutes, (between 5-15 minutes) depending
on performance needs

`Circulation <#circcron>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Holds Queue <#buildholdscron>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script path: misc/cronjobs/holds/build\_holds\_queue.pl

Does: Updates holds queue report

Required by: `Holds Queue Report <#holdsqueue>`__

Frequency suggestion: every 1-4 hours

Description:

-  A script that should be run periodically if your library system
   allows borrowers to place on-shelf holds. This script decides which
   library should be responsible for fulfilling a given hold request.

   It's behavior is controlled by the system preferences
   `StaticHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__ and
   `RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight <#holdqueueweight>`__.

   If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the
   on-shelf holds fulfillment process, you should list the the libraries
   that \*do\* participate in the process here by inputting all the
   participating library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g.
   "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc. ).

   By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system
   will first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the
   pickup library if possible. If there are no items available at the
   pickup library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use
   the list of libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled ( which it is by default ), the
   script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
   placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

   For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
   small, medium and large ) and you want the burden of holds
   fulfillment to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you
   would want StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like
   "LRG,MED,SML".

   If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
   throughout your library system, simply enable
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight. When this system preference is enabled,
   the order in which libraries will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf
   hold will be randomized each time the list is regenerated.

   Leaving StaticHoldsQueueWeight empty is contraindicated at this time.
   Doing so will cause the build\_holds\_queue script to ignore
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight, causing the script to request hold
   fulfillment not randomly, but by alphabetical order.

Execute without options for help.

**DESCRIPTION**

--lost \| -l

This option takes the form of n=lv, where n is num days overdue, and lv
is the lost value. See warning below.

--charge \| -c

This specifies what lost value triggers Koha to charge the account for
the lost item. Replacement costs are not charged if this is not
specified.

--verbose \| v

verbose.

--confirm

confirm. without this option, the script will report the number of
affected items and return without modifying any records.

--quiet

suppress summary output.

**NAME**

update\_totalissues.pl

**SYNOPSIS**

update\_totalissues.pl --use-stats

update\_totalissues.pl --use-items

update\_totalissues.pl --commit=1000

update\_totalissues.pl --since='2012-01-01'

update\_totalissues.pl --interval=30d

**DESCRIPTION**

This batch job populates bibliographic records' total issues count based
on historical issue statistics.

--help Prints this help

-v\|--verbose

Provide verbose log information (list every bib modified).

--use-stats

Use the data in the statistics table for populating total issues.

--use-items

Use items.issues data for populating total issues. Note that issues data
from the items table does not respect the --since or --interval options,
by definition. Also note that if both --use-stats and --use-items are
specified, the count of biblios processed will be misleading.

-s\|--since=DATE

Only process issues recorded in the statistics table since DATE.

-i\|--interval=S

Only process issues recorded in the statistics table in the last N units
of time. The interval should consist of a number with a one- letter unit
suffix. The valid suffixes are h (hours), d (days), w (weeks), m
(months), and y (years). The default unit is days.

--incremental

Add the number of issues found in the statistics table to the existing
total issues count. Intended so that this script can be used as a cron
job to update popularity information during low-usage periods. If
neither --since or --interval are specified, incremental mode will
default to processing the last twenty-four hours.

--commit=N

Commit the results to the database after every N records are processed.

--test

Only test the popularity population script.

**WARNING**

If the time on your database server does not match the time on your Koha
server you will need to take that into account, and probably use the
--since argument instead of the --interval argument for incremental
updating.

items

**SYNOPSIS**

overdue\_notices.pl [ -n ] [ -library <branchcode> ] [ -library
<branchcode>...] [ -max <number of days> ] [ -csv [ <filename> ] ]
[-itemscontent <field list> ]

Options:

-help brief help message

-man full documentation

-n No email will be sent

-max <days> maximum days overdue to deal with

-library <branchname> only deal with overdues from this library
(repeatable : several libraries can be given)

-csv <filename> populate CSV file

-html <filename> Output html to file

-itemscontent <list of fields> item information in templates

-borcat <categorycode> category code that must be included

-borcatout <categorycode> category code that must be excluded

**OPTIONS**

-help Print a brief help message and exits.

-man Prints the manual page and exits.

-v Verbose. Without this flag set, only fatal errors are reported.

-n Do not send any email. Overdue notices that would have been sent to
the patrons or to the admin are printed to standard out. CSV data (if
the -csv flag is set) is written to standard out or to any csv filename
given.

-max Items older than max days are assumed to be handled somewhere else,
probably the longoverdues.pl script. They are therefore ignored by this
program. No notices are sent for them, and they are not added to any CSV
files. Defaults to 90 to match longoverdues.pl.

-library

select overdues for one specific library. Use the value in the
branches.branchcode table. This option can be repeated in order to
select overdues for a group of libraries.

-csv Produces CSV data. if -n (no mail) flag is set, then this CSV data
is sent to standard out or to a filename if provided. Otherwise, only
overdues that could not be emailed are sent in CSV format to the admin.

-itemscontent

comma separated list of fields that get substituted into templates in
places of the <<items.content>> placeholder. This defaults to
issuedate,title,barcode,author

Other possible values come from fields in the biblios, items, and issues
tables.

-borcat Repetable field, that permit to select only few of patrons
categories.

-borcatout

Repetable field, permis to exclude some patrons categories.

-t \| --triggered

This option causes a notice to be generated if and only if an item is
overdue by the number of days defined in a notice trigger.

By default, a notice is sent each time the script runs, which is
suitable for less frequent run cron script, but requires syncing notice
triggers with the cron schedule to ensure proper behavior. Add the
--triggered option for daily cron, at the risk of no notice being
generated if the cron fails to run on time.

-list-all

Default items.content lists only those items that fall in the range of
the currently processing notice. Choose list-all to include all overdue
items in the list (limited by -max setting).

**DESCRIPTION**

This script is designed to alert patrons and administrators of overdue
items.

Configuration

This script pays attention to the overdue notice configuration performed
in the "Overdue notice/status triggers" section of the "Tools" area of
the staff interface to Koha. There, you can choose which letter
templates are sent out after a configurable number of days to patrons of
each library. More information about the use of this section of Koha is
available in the Koha manual.

The templates used to craft the emails are defined in the "Tools:
Notices" section of the staff interface to Koha.

Outgoing emails

Typically, messages are prepared for each patron with overdue items.
Messages for whom there is no email address on file are collected and
sent as attachments in a single email to each library administrator, or
if that is not set, then to the email address in the
"KohaAdminEmailAddress" system preference.

These emails are staged in the outgoing message queue, as are messages
produced by other features of Koha. This message queue must be processed
regularly by the misc/cronjobs/process\_message\_queue.pl program.

In the event that the "-n" flag is passed to this program, no emails are
sent. Instead, messages are sent on standard output from this program.
They may be redirected to a file if desired.

Templates

Templates can contain variables enclosed in double angle brackets like
<<this>>. Those variables will be replaced with values specific to the
overdue items or relevant patron. Available variables are:

<<bib>>

the name of the library

<<items.content>>

one line for each item, each line containing a tab separated list of
title, author, barcode, issuedate

<<borrowers.\*>>

any field from the borrowers table

<<branches.\*>>

any field from the branches table

CSV output

The "-csv" command line option lets you specify a file to which overdues
data should be output in CSV format.

With the "-n" flag set, data about all overdues is written to the file.
Without that flag, only information about overdues that were unable to
be sent directly to the patrons will be written. In other words, this
CSV file replaces the data that is typically sent to the administrator
email address.

**USAGE EXAMPLES**

"overdue\_notices.pl" - In this most basic usage, with no command line
arguments, all libraries are processed individually, and notices are
prepared for all patrons with overdue items for whom we have email
addresses. Messages for those patrons for whom we have no email address
are sent in a single attachment to the library administrator's email
address, or to the address in the KohaAdminEmailAddress system
preference.

"overdue\_notices.pl -n -csv /tmp/overdues.csv" - sends no email and
populates /tmp/overdues.csv with information about all overdue items.

"overdue\_notices.pl -library MAIN max 14" - prepare notices of overdues
in the last 2 weeks for the MAIN library.

**SEE ALSO**

The misc/cronjobs/advance\_notices.pl program allows you to send
messages to patrons in advance of their items becoming due, or to alert
them of items that have just become due.

**INTERNAL METHODS**

These methods are internal to the operation of overdue\_notices.pl.

parse\_letter

parses the letter template, replacing the placeholders with data
specific to this patron, biblio, or item

named parameters:

letter - required hashref

borrowernumber - required integer

substitute - optional hashref of other key/value pairs that should be
substituted in the letter content

returns the "letter" hashref, with the content updated to reflect the
substituted keys and values.

prepare\_letter\_for\_printing

returns a string of text appropriate for printing in the event that an
overdue notice will not be sent to the patron's email address. Depending
on the desired output format, this may be a CSV string, or a
human-readable representation of the notice.

'http:'. For example, if --host=http://www.mylib.com, then when 856$u
contains 'img/image.jpg', the url checked is:
http://www.mylib.com/image.jpg'.

--verbose\|-v

Outputs both successful and failed URLs.

--html

Formats output in HTML. The result can be redirected to a file
accessible by http. This way, it's possible to link directly to biblio
record in edit mode. With this parameter --host-pro is required.

--host-pro=http://koha-pro.tld

Server host used to link to biblio record editing page.

**NAME**

cloud-kw.pl - Creates HTML keywords clouds from Koha Zebra Indexes

**USAGE**

cloud-kw.pl [--verbose\|--help] --conf=cloud.conf

Creates multiple HTML files containing keywords cloud with top terms
sorted by their logarithmic weight. cloud.conf is a YAML configuration
file driving cloud generation process.

**PARAMETERS**

--conf=configuration file

Specify configuration file name

--verbose\|-v

Enable script verbose mode.

--help\|-h

Print this help page.

**CONFIGURATION**

Configuration file looks like that:

::

      ---
             # Koha configuration file for a specific installation
             # If not present, defaults to KOHA_CONF
             KohaConf: /home/koha/mylibray/etc/koha-conf.xml
             # Zebra index to scan
             ZebraIndex: Author
             # Koha index used to link found kewords with an opac search URL
             KohaIndex: au
             # Number of top keyword to use for the cloud
             Count: 50
             # Include CSS style directives with the cloud
             # This could be used as a model and then CSS directives are
             # put in the appropriate CSS file directly.
             Withcss: Yes
             # HTML file where to output the cloud
             Output: /home/koha/mylibrary/koharoot/koha-tmpl/cloud-author.html
            ---
             KohaConf: /home/koha/yourlibray/etc/koha-conf.xml
             ZebraIndex: Subject
             KohaIndex: su
             Count: 200
             Withcss: no
             Output: /home/koha/yourlibrary/koharoot/koha-tmpl/cloud-subject.html

**IMPROVEMENTS**

Generated top terms have more informations than those outputted from the
time being. Some parameters could be easily added to improve this
script:

WithCount

In order to output terms with the number of occurrences they have been
found in Koha Catalogue by Zebra.

CloudLevels

Number of levels in the cloud. Now 24 levels are hardcoded.

Weighting

Weighting method used to distribute terms in the cloud. We could have
two values: Logarithmic and Linear. Now it's Logarithmic by default.

Order

Now terms are outputted in the lexical order. They could be sorted by
their weight.

`Share Usage Stats <#usagecron>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Script path: misc/cronjobs/share\_usage\_with\_koha\_community.pl

Does: If you're sharing information via the `UsageStats <#UsageStats>`__
feature this will send your info to the `Hea
website <http://hea.koha-community.org/>`__.

Frequency: monthly

`Perl Documentation <#usagecronperl>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**NAME**

share\_usage\_with\_koha\_community.pl - Share your library's usage with
the Koha community

**SYNOPSIS**

share\_usage\_with\_koha\_community.pl [-h\|--help] [-v\|--verbose]

If the `UsageStats <#UsageStats>`__ system preference is set, you can
launch this script to share your usage data anonymously with the Koha
community.

Collecting Koha usage statistics will help developers to know how Koha
is used across the world.

This script will send the usage data for the bibliographic and authority
records, checkouts, holds, orders, and subscriptions.

Only the total number is retrieved. In no case will private data be
shared!

In order to know which parts of Koha modules are used, this script will
collect some system preference values.

If you want to tell us who you are, you can fill the
`UsageStatsLibraryName <#UsageStatsLibraryName>`__ system preference
with your library name,
`UsageStatsLibraryUrl <#UsageStatsLibraryUrl>`__,
`UsageStatsLibraryType <#UsageStatsLibraryType>`__ and/or
`UsageStatsCountry <#UsageStatsCountry>`__.

All these data will be analyzed on the http://hea.koha-community.org
Koha community website.

IMPORTANT : please do NOT run the cron on the 1st, but on another day.
The idea is to avoid all Koha libraries sending their data at the same
time ! So choose any day between 1 and 28 !

**OPTIONS**

-h\|--help

Print a brief help message

-v\|--verbose

Verbose mode.

-f\|--force

Force the update.

`OAI-PMH <#OAI-PMHservice>`__
-----------------------------

For the Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
(OAI-PMH) there are two groups of 'participants': Data Providers and
Service Providers. Data Providers (open archives, repositories) provide
free access to metadata, and may, but do not necessarily, offer free
access to full texts or other resources. OAI-PMH provides an easy to
implement, low barrier solution for Data Providers. Service Providers
use the OAI interfaces of the Data Providers to harvest and store
metadata. Note that this means that there are no live search requests to
the Data Providers; rather, services are based on the harvested data via
OAI-PMH.

Koha at present can only act as a Data Provider. It can not harvest from
other repositories. The biggest stumbling block to having Koha harvest
from other repositories is that MARC is the only metadata format that
Koha indexes natively. Visit
http://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/english/page3.htm for diagrams of how
OAI-PMH works.

Learn more about OAI-PMH at: http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/

To enable OAI-PMH in Koha edit the `OAI-PMH <#OAI-PMH>`__ preference.
Once enabled you can visit http://YOURKOHACATALOG/cgi-bin/koha/oai.pl to
see your file.

`REST services <#Rest-services>`__
----------------------------------

Koha can now be requested by REST http requests. BibLibre wrotes an
external module to adds more possibilities than ILS-DI can provide.There
is no authentication process, but authorized ips are listed in the
config file. Services have been tested in 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14 koha
versions. You can find more information about it into README file and
opac/rest.pl documentation on http://git.biblibre.com. If you want to
add features, send us a patch at dev\_patches AT biblibre DOT com.

Services provided in 1.4 version are:

Using the SRU server
====================

`Using the SRU server <#usingsru>`__
------------------------------------

Koha implements the Search/Retrieve via URL (SRU) protocol. More
information about the protocol itself can be found at
http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/. The version implemented is version
1.1.

`Explain <#sru_explain>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to have information about the implementation of SRU on a
given server, you should have access to the Explain file using a request
to the server without any parameter. Like
<http://myserver.com:9999/biblios/>. The response from the server is an
XML file that should look like the following and will give you
information about the default settings of the SRU server.

::

`Search <#sru_search>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This url :
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=reefs
is composed of the following elements:

-  base url of the SRU server : http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?

-  search part with the 3 required parameters : version, operation and
   query. The parameters within the search part should be of the
   key=value form, and can be combined with the & character.

One can add optional parameters to the query, for instance
maximumRecords indicating the maximum number of records to be returned
by the server. So
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=reefs&maximumRecords=5
will only get the first 5 results results from the server.

http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/sru1-1archive/search-retrieve-operation.html
gives more details about the search operations and in particular the
list of optional parameters for searching.

`More details about Search <#sru_search_more_details>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "operation" key can take two values: scan or searchRetrieve.

If operation=searchRetrieve, then the search key should be query. As in
: operation=searchRetrieve&query=reefs

If operation=scan, then the search key should be scanClause. As in :
operation=scan&scanClause=reefs

etc/zebradb/biblios/etc/bib1.att defines Zebra/3950 indexes that exist
on your system. For instance you'll see that we have indexes for Subject
and for Title: att 21 Subject and att 4 Title respectively.

In the pqf.properties file located under etc/zebradb/pqf.properties I
see that an access point already uses my Subject index (index.dc.subject
= 1=21) while another uses my Title index (index.dc.title = 1=4) I know
this is my Subject index because as I've seen just before in my bib1.att
file, it's called with =1=21 in Z3950: so index.dc.subject = 1=21
correctly points to my Subject index. And Title was called with 1=4 so
index.dc.title = 1=4 correctly points to my Title index. I can now
construct my query just like I would in a search box, just preceding it
with the "query" key: query=Subject=reefs and Title=coral searches
"reefs" in the subject and "coral" in the title. The full url would be
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=Subject=reefs
and Title=coral If I want to limit the result set to just 5 records, I
can do
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=Subject=reefs
and Title=coral&maximumRecords=5

I can also play with truncate, relations, etc. Those are also defined in
my pqf.properties file. I can see for instance the position properties
defined as:

                   position.first              = 3=1 6=1
                  # "first in field"
                   position.any                = 3=3 6=1
                     # "any position in field"
                   

So as an example if I want "coral" to be at the beginning of the title,
I can do this query :
http://myserver.com:9999/biblios?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=Title=coral
first

New titles slider for OPAC
==========================

Often times libraries will want to add a flowing widget with new
materials at the library to their main public catalog page. To do this
you can use a widget from any number of services (usually for a cost) or
you can `enable plugins <#pluginsystem>`__ in Koha and use the `Cover
Flow
plugin <http://git.bywatersolutions.com/koha-plugins.git/shortlog/refs/heads/cover_flow>`__
which is based on the
`Flipster <https://github.com/drien/jquery-flipster>`__, a responsive
jQuery coverflow plugin.

Once the plugin is installed, the steps to get your coverflow to show up
are as follows:

First, you need to create one or more public reports for your coverflow
widget or widgets to be based on. This is how the plugin knows what the
content of your widget should contain. Each report needs only three
columns; title, biblionumber, and isbn. It is important that you have a
good and valid isbn, as that is the datum used to actually fetch the
cover. In the iteration of the plugin, we are using Amazon cover images,
but I believe in the end I will make the cover image fetcher
configurable so we can use any data source for cover image fetching.

Second, we need to configure the plugin. The plugin configuration is a
single text area that uses YAML ( actually, it’s JSON, whcih is a subset
of YAML ) to store the configuration options. In this example it looks
like this:

::

    - id: 42
      selector: #coverflow
      options:
      style: coverflow

In this example, we are telling the plugin to use the report with id 42,
and use it to create a coverflow widget to replace the HTML element with
the id “coverflow”. The options list is passed directly to Flipster, so
any options supported by Flipster can be set from the plugin
configuration! In fact, in addition to the traditional coverflow,
Flipster has a “carousel” mode which is a much more compact version of
the coverflow. You can also configure which cover the widget will start
on, among other options.

At the time the plugins options are saved or updated, the plugin will
then generate some minified JavaScript code that is automatically stored
in the Koha system preference OPACUserJS. Here is an example of the
output:

::

    /* JS for Koha CoverFlow Plugin 
     This JS was added automatically by installing the CoverFlow plugin
     Please do not modify */$(document).ready(function(){$.getScript("/plugin/Koha/Plugin/Com/ByWaterSolutions/CoverFlow/jquery-flipster/src/js/jquery.flipster.min.js",function(data,textStatus,jqxhr){$("head").append("<link id='flipster-css' href='/plugin/Koha/Plugin/Com/ByWaterSolutions/CoverFlow/jquery-flipster/src/css/jquery.flipster.min.css' type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' />");$('#coverflow').load("/coverflow.pl?id=42",function(){var opt={'items':'.item','minfactor':15,'distribution':1.5,'scalethreshold':0,'staticbelowthreshold':false,'titleclass':'itemTitle','selectedclass':'selectedItem','scrollactive':true,'step':{'limit':4,'width':10,'scale':true}};$('#coverflow').flipster({style:'coverflow',});});});});
    /* End of JS for Koha CoverFlow Plugin */

Why do this? For speed! Rather than regenerating this code each and
every time the page loads, we can generate it once, and use it over and
over again.

If you inspect the code closely, you’ll notice it references a script
“coverflow.pl”. This is a script that is included with the coverflow
plugin. Since we need to access this from the OPAC ( and we don’t want
to set off any XSS attack alarms ), we need to modify the web server
configuration for the public catalog and add the followup to it:

::

    ScriptAlias /coverflow.pl "/var/lib/koha/mykoha/plugins/Koha/Plugin/Com/ByWaterSolutions/CoverFlow/coverflow.pl"

This line gives us access to the coverflow.pl script from the OPAC. This
script retrieves the report data and passes it back to the public
catalog for creating the coverflow widget. Koha::Cache is supported in
order to make the widget load as quickly as possible!

The final step is to put your selector element somewhere in your public
catalog. In this example, I put the following in the system preference
OpacMainUserBlock:

::

    <span id="coverflow">Loading...</span>

Once that is in place, you need only refresh your OPAC page, and there
you have it, your very own catalog coverflow widget! Not only do these
coverflows look great on a computer screen, but they look great on
mobile platforms as well, and are even touch responsive!Coverflow Widget

Configuring Receipt Printers
============================

The following instructions are for specific receipt printers, but can
probably be used to help with setup of other brands as well.

`For Epson TM-T88III (3) & TM-T88IV (4) Printers <#epsonprinters>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------

`In the Print Driver <#epsonprintdriver>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For these instructions, we are using version 5,0,3,0 of the Epson
TM-T88III print driver; the EPSON TM-T88IV version is ReceiptE4.
Register at the `EpsonExpert Technical Resource Center
website <https://www.epsonexpert.com/login>`__ to gain access to the
drivers; go to Technical Resources, then choose the printer model from
the Printers drop-down list.

Click Start > Printers and Faxes > Right click the receipt printer >
Properties:

-  Advanced Tab, click Printing Defaults button

-  Layout Tab: Paper size: Roll Paper 80 x 297mm

-  TM-T88III: Layout Tab: Check Reduce Printing and Fit to Printable
   Width

-  TM-T88IV: Check Reduced Size Print; Click OK on the popup window that
   appears. Fit to Printable Width should be automatically selected.

-  OK your way out of there.

`In Firefox <#epsonfirefox>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under File > Page Setup:

-  Shrink to fit page on Format & Options tab

-  0,0,0,0 for Margins on Margins & Header/Footer Tab. This makes the
   receipts use all available space on the paper roll.

-  Set all Headers/Footers to -blank-. This removes all of the gunk you
   might normally find on a print from Firefox, such as the URL, number
   of pages, etc.

-  Click OK

Set the default printer settings in Firefox so you don't see a "Print"
dialog:

-  Go to File > Print

-  Set the Printer to the receipt printer.

-  Click the Advanced (or Properties) button

-  Layout Tab: Paper size: Roll Paper 80 x 297mm

-  TM-T88III: Layout Tab: Check Reduce Printing and Fit to Printable
   Width

-  TM-T88IV: Check Reduced Size Print; click OK on the popup window that
   appears. Fit to Printable Width should be automatically selected.

-  OK your way out, go ahead and print whatever page you are on.

-  Type about:config, in the address bar. Click "I'll be careful, I
   promise!" on the warning message.

-  Type, print.always in Filter.

-  Look for print.always\_print\_silent.

   -  If the preference is there then set the value to true.

-  If the preference is not there (and it shouldn't be in most browsers)
   you have to add the preference.

   -  Right click the preference area and select New > Boolean

   -  Type print.always\_print\_silent in the dialog box and set the
      value to True. This sets the print settings in Firefox to always
      use the same settings and print without showing a dialog box.

    **Warning**

    Setting the print.always\_print\_silent setting in about:config
    DISABLES the ability to choose a printer in Firefox.

`For Epson TM-T88II (2) Printers <#epson2>`__
---------------------------------------------

Register at the `EpsonExpert Technical Resource Center
website <https://www.epsonexpert.com/login>`__ to gain access to the
drivers; go to Technical Resources, then choose the printer model from
the Printers drop-down list.

`In Firefox <#epson2firefox>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under File > Page Setup:

-  Shrink to fit page on Format & Options tab

-  0,0,0,0 for Margins on Margins & Header/Footer Tab. This makes the
   receipts use all available space on the paper roll.

-  Set all Headers/Footers to -blank-. This removes all of the gunk you
   might normally find on a print from Firefox, such as the URL, number
   of pages, etc.

-  Click OK

Set the default printer settings in Firefox so you don't see a "Print"
dialog:

-  Go to File > Print

-  Set the Printer to the receipt printer.

-  Print whatever page you are on.

-  Type about:config, in the address bar. Click "I'll be careful, I
   promise!" on the warning message.

-  Type, print.always in Filter.

-  Look for, print.always\_print\_silent.

   -  If the preference is there then set the value to true.

-  If the preference is not there (and it shouldn't be in most browsers)
   you have to add the preference.

   -  Right click the preference area and select New > Boolean

   -  Type, print.always\_print\_silent in the dialog box and set the
      value to True. This sets the print settings in Firefox to always
      use the same settings and print without showing a dialog box.

    **Warning**

    Setting the print.always\_print\_silent setting in about:config
    DISABLES the ability to choose a printer in Firefox.

`For Star SP542 Printers <#starprinter>`__
------------------------------------------

`Installing the Printer <#installstarprinter>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the following comments are based on the Star SP542 receipt
printer, they probably apply to all printers in the SP5xx series.

The Star SP542 receipt printer works well with Koha and **Firefox on
Windows XP SP3**. This printer, with either the parallel or USB
interface, is fairly easy to install and configure. You will need the
following executable file which is available from numerous places on the
Internet:

linemode\_2k-xp\_20030205.exe

This executable actually does all of the installation; you will not need
to use the Microsoft Windows "Add Printer" program. We recommend that
when installing, the option for the software monitor not be selected; we
have experienced significant pauses and delays in printing with it.
Instead, simply choose to install the receipt printer without the
monitor.

Additionally, the install program may not put the printer on the correct
port, especially if using the USB interface. This is easily corrected by
going to "Start -> Printers and Faxes -> Properties for the SP542
printer -> Ports", then check the appropriate port.

A reboot may be required, even if not indicated by the installation
software or the operating system.

**Windows 7** users should refer to this page:
http://www.starmicronics.com/supports/win7.aspx.

`Configuring Firefox to Print to Receipt Printer <#firefoxreceipt>`__
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Open File > Page Setup

-  Make all the headers and footers blank

-  Set the margins to 0 (zero)

-  In the address bar of Firefox, type about:config

-  Search for print.always\_print\_silent and double click it

-  Change it from false to true

   -  This lets you skip the Print pop up box that comes up, as well as
      skipping the step where you have to click OK, automatically
      printing the right sized slip.

-  If print.always\_print\_silent does not come up

   -  Right click on a blank area of the preference window

   -  Select new > Boolean

   -  Enter "print.always\_print\_silent" as the name (without quotes)

   -  Click OK

   -  Select true for the value

-  You may also want to check what is listed for print.print\_printer

   -  You may have to choose Generic/Text Only (or whatever your receipt
      printer might be named)

Notice & Slips Guides

This guide will break down the notices and slips information in 3 ways.
First it will tell you what file generates the notice, then how you will
present the item info in that notice and finally if the notice can be
branch specific or not.

Sample Serials
==============

`Reader's Digest (0034-0375) <#readersdigestsample>`__
------------------------------------------------------

-  Published 12 times a year (monthly)

-  The Volume number changes every 6 months and the numbers continues on
   (requires an advanced pattern).

   Sample Reader's Digest Subscription
   |image1069|

`People Weekly (1076-0091) <#peoplesample>`__
---------------------------------------------

-  Published weekly

   -  The website says "on Saturday except the first week of August,
      Thanksgiving week, the first and last weeks of the year" but this
      does not match the pattern for 2007 or 2008

-  In the Jul-Dec there are 26 issues

-  In the Jan-Jun there are 25 issues (no issue for the first week of
   January)

Since the irregularity on the first # 26 does not skip a week, this
would be set up as to roll over on issue 25. The 26th issue in the
second half of the year would have to be received as a supplemental.

The irregularity check will complain that 52 issues were expected, but
25 entered. The current irregularity check can only check that the first
position of the numbering pattern matches the expected issue count of
the periodicity. But we do need to trigger the rollover on the volume,
so we need to define the last two weeks of the year as irregularities.
So we receive 50 issues the first 50 weeks, then one supplemental issue
in week 51, which we have to define the enumeration for, then the next
predicted issue will be the following year's first week.

`Et-Mol <#hebrewserialsample>`__
--------------------------------

This journal is published with the following rules:

-  6 issues a year (every 2 months)

-  year changes every 6 issues

-  we start in 2011

-  the issue number goes up indefinitely

-  starting from issue 215

The planning would look like this:

Sample for this Hebrew Journal
|image1070|

`Backpacker (0277-867X) <#backpackerserial>`__
----------------------------------------------

Published 9 times a year irregularly. The issues continues while the
volume and number rolls over every 9 issues. If you're holding Volume
41, Number 3, Issue 302 in your hand the prediction would look like
this:

Backpacker numbering pattern
|image1071|

And the received issues would number like this:

v. 41, no. 3, iss. 302  

v. 41, no. 4, iss. 303

v. 41, no. 5, iss. 304

v. 41, no. 6, iss. 305

v. 41, no. 7, iss. 306

v. 41, no. 8, iss. 307

v. 41, no. 9, iss. 308

v. 42, no. 1, iss. 309

v. 42, no. 2, iss. 310

v. 42, no. 3, iss. 311

v. 42, no. 4, iss. 312

`Keats-Shelley Journal (0453-4387) <#keatsserial>`__

this pattern:  

-  Vol. 61 2013

-  Vol. 62 2014

-  Vol. 63 2015

Setup should look like this (if you're starting in July 2014):

Using Koha as a Content Management System (CMS)
===============================================

`Setup <#kohacmssetup>`__
-------------------------

These are instructions for taking a default install of Koha and allowing
it to function as a little content management system. This will allow a
library to publish an arbitrary number of pages based on a template.
This example uses the template for the main opac page, but you could
just as well use any template you wish with a bit more editing. This may
be appropriate if you have a small library, want to allow librarians to
easily add pages, and do not want to support a complete CMS.

-  Copy /usr/share/koha/opac/cgi-bin/opac/opac-main.pl to
   /usr/share/koha/opac/cgi-bin/opac/pages.pl (in the same directory)

-  Edit pages.pl in an editor

-  At approximately line 33 change this code:

   ::

       template_name  => "opac-main.tmpl",

-  To this code:

   ::

       template_name  => "pages.tmpl", 

-  At approximately line 62 after this code:

   ::

       $template->param( 
                  koha_news       => $all_koha_news, 
                  koha_news_count => $koha_news_count,
                  display_daily_quote => C4::Context->preference('QuoteOfTheDay'),
                  daily_quote         => $quote,
                  );

-  Add these lines:

   ::

               my $page = "page_" . $input->param('p');          # go for "p" value in URL and do the concatenation
               my $preference = C4::Context->preference($page);  # Go for preference  
               $template->{VARS}->{'page_test'} = $preference;   # pass variable to template pages.tt

-  Note pages.pl file must have Webserver user execution permissions,
   you can use `chmod <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod>`__ command if
   you are actually logged in as such user:

   ::

               $chmod 755 pages.pl

-  In the browser go to Home > Administration > System Preferences >
   Local Use and add a New Preference called "page\_test"

-  Fill it out as so

   -  Explanation: test page for pages tiny cms

   -  Variable: page\_test

   -  Value: Lorem ipsum

   -  Click the TextArea link (or enter "TextArea" into the input field
      below it)

   -  variable options (last field): 80\|50

-  In a browser go to http://youraddress/cgi-bin/koha/pages.pl?p=test
   The page should come up with the words "Lorem ipsum" in the main
   content area of the page. (replace "youraddress" with localhost,
   127.0.0.1, or your domain name depending on how you have Apache set
   up.)

-  To add more pages simply create a system preference where the title
   begins with "page\_" followed by any arbitrary letters. You can add
   any markup you want as the value of the field. Reference the new page
   by changing the value of the "p" parameter in the URL.

`Editing the pages template <#kohacmstmpl>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file to create / edit for the pages template will depend on your
`opacthemes <#opacthemes>`__ system preference setting

`Editing 'bootstrap' theme template (current) <#kohacmstmplboot>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Copy
   /usr/share/koha/opac/htdocs/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/modules/opac-main.tt
   to
   /usr/share/koha/opac/htdocs/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/modules/pages.tt

-  Edit
   /usr/share/koha/opac/htdocs/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/modules/pages.tt

-  At approximately line 61, change this:

   ::

               [% IF ( OpacMainUserBlock ) %]<div id="opacmainuserblock">[% OpacMainUserBlock %]</div>[% END %]

-  To this:

   ::

               [% IF ( page_test ) %]<div id="opacmainuserblock">[% page_test %]</div>[% END %]

Remark: You may wish to disable your News block of these CMS style pages
e.g. when you do not want it displayed on the CMS style pages or where
the News block is long enough that it actually makes the 'page\_test'
include scroll outside the default viewport dimensions. In that case,
remove the following code from your pages.tt template.

::

                      [% IF ( koha_news_count ) %]
                          <div id="news">
                          <table class="table table-bordered">
                          [% FOREACH koha_new IN koha_news %]
                            <thead><tr><th>[% koha_new.title %]</th></tr></thead>
                            <tbody><tr><td><p>[% koha_new.new %]</p>
                            <p class="newsfooter"><i>(published on [% koha_new.newdate %])</i></p></td></tr></tbody>
                          [% END %]
                          </table>
                          </div>
                         [% END %]

If you have problems check file permissions on pages.pl and pages.tmpl.
They should have the same user and group as other Koha files like
opac-main.pl.

`Bonus Points <#kohacmsbonus>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using the address
http://youraddress/cgi-bin/koha/pages.pl?p=test you can shorten it to
http://youraddress/pages.pl?p=test Just open up
/etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf and add the follow at about line 13:

::

    ScriptAlias /pages.pl "/usr/share/koha/opac/cgi-bin/opac/pages.pl" 

Then restart Apache.

`Usage <#kohacmsusage>`__
-------------------------

After setting up Koha as a CMS you can create new pages following these
instructions:

`Adding Pages <#kohacmspages>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new page you need to add a system preference under Local Use.

-  Get there: More > Administration > Global System Preferences > Local
   Use

-  Click 'New Preference'

-  Enter in a description in the Explanation field

-  Enter a value that starts with 'page\_' in the Variable field

-  Enter starting HTML in the Value field

   Add a new preference
   |image1076|

-  Set the Variable Type to Textarea

-  Set the Variable options to something like 20\|20 for 20 rows and 20
   columns

   Settings for the new preference
   |image1077|

`Viewing your page <#kohacmsview>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view your new page at
http://YOUR-OPAC/cgi-bin/koha/pages.pl?p=PAGENAME where PAGENAME is the
part you entered after 'page\_' in the Variable field.

`Example <#kohacmsexpage>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This process can be used to create recommended reading lists within
Koha. So once the code changes have been made per the instructions on
'Koha as a CMS' you go through the 'Adding a New Page' instructions
above to great a page for 'Recommended Reading Lists'

Create page by modifying a system preference
|image1078|

Next we need to create pages for our various classes (or categories). To
do this, return to the 'Adding a New Page' section and create a
preference for the first class.

Add a new sys pref for another page
|image1079|

Next you'll want to link your first page to your new second page, go to
the page\_recommend preference and click 'Edit.' Now you want to edit
the HTML to include a link to your newest page:

Edit original preference to add new page

-  The Crawford Library at Dallas Christian College is using this method
   for their recommended reading lists: http://opac.dallas.edu/

Resetting the Koha Database
===========================

These notes on how to reset the database for Koha were derived from the
following email thread:
http://lists.koha-community.org/pipermail/koha-devel/2009-January/008939.html
and http://lists.katipo.co.nz/public/koha/2014-June/039701.html

Resetting the database may be useful if you install Koha with the sample
data, and then wish to use real data without reinstalling the software.

`Delete sample data from Tables <#deletetables>`__
--------------------------------------------------

Use your preferred MySQL client to
`delete <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/delete.html>`__ the
following tables:

-  bibio

-  biblioitems

-  items

-  auth\_header

-  sessions

-  zebraqueue

You may need to disable foreign key checks to delete data from same
tables. For instructions follow this thread:
https://lists.katipo.co.nz/pipermail/koha/2013-July/036853.html.

`Reset the Zebra Index <#resetzebra>`__
---------------------------------------

Run the following commands to reset the authorities and biblios Zebra
indices.

::

    $ zebraidx -c /etc/koha/zebradb/zebra-authorities-dom.cfg -g iso2709 -d authorities init 
    $ zebraidx -c /etc/koha/zebradb/zebra-biblios.cfg -g iso2709 -d biblios init 

If you are running a package install then you'll want to run the
following commands to reset the authorities and biblios Zebra indices
instead:

::

    $ sudo zebraidx -c /etc/koha/sites/YOURLIBRARY/zebra-authorities-dom.cfg  -g iso2709 -d authorities init 
    $ sudo zebraidx -c /etc/koha/sites/YOURLIBRARY/zebra-biblios.cfg  -g iso2709 -d biblios init 

Replacing YOURLIBRARY with your Koha installation name.

Koha XSLT Item Types
====================

When you have any of the XSLT system preferences
(`OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay <#OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay>`__,
`OPACXSLTResultsDisplay <#OPACXSLTResultsDisplay>`__,
`XSLTDetailsDisplay <#XSLTDetailsDisplay>`__, and/or
`XSLTResultsDisplay <#XSLTResultsDisplay>`__) along with the
`DisplayOPACiconsXSLT <#DisplayOPACiconsXSLT>`__ and
`DisplayIconsXSLT <#DisplayIconsXSLT>`__ preferences turned on you will
see item type icons on the related screen.

    **Important**

    These images are coming from values found in your leader, if your
    leader is not cataloged properly it might be best to turn off the
    `DisplayOPACiconsXSLT <#DisplayOPACiconsXSLT>`__ preference (which
    can be done while leaving the other XSLT preferences turned on).

MarcEdit
========

Many libraries like to use MarcEdit for modifications or data cleanup.
If you'd like to do this you will need to download it at:
http://marcedit.reeset.net/

    **Important**

    Many of the actions described in this chapter can be done in Koha
    using `Marc Modification Templates <#marcmodtemplates>`__, but this
    section is here for those who are used to MarcEdit.

`Adding a prefix to call numbers <#marceditprefix>`__
-----------------------------------------------------

When bringing data into Koha, you may want to first clean it up. One
common action among Koha users is to add a prefix to the call number.

-  Open MarcEdit

   MarcEdit
   |image1089|

-  Click 'MarcEditor'

-  Go to Tools > Edit Subfield Data

   Edit subfield data
   |image1090|

-  To prepend data the special character is: ^b  To simply prepend data
   to the beginning of a subfield, add ^b to the Field Data: textbox and
   the data to be appended in the Replace

   Prepend data to a field
   |image1091|

   -  To prepend data to the beginning of the subfield while replacing a
      text string, add ^b[string to replace] to the Field Data textbox
      and the data to be appended in the Replace With textbox.

`Importing Excel data into Koha <#marceditexcel>`__
---------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have records of your library in excel data sheet format and
want them to import into Koha. But how will you do this? Koha will not
let you import excel records directly. Well here is a very simple
solution for you which will let you import your excel records in Koha
easily. First, we will convert excel file into Marc file and then will
import it into Koha.

Follow the given steps to import your excel records into Koha

`Converting from Excel format into .mrk format <#convertexcel>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we will convert excel format into .mrk format. For this we will
use MarcEdit. You can download it from http://marcedit.reeset.net/

Now open it and select Add-ins-->Delimited Text Translator.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1092|

Click Next when the following window appears.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1093|

Browse for your excel file.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1094|

Locate your excel file by choosing the format Excel File(\*.xls).

Delimited Text Translator
|image1095|

Similarly, fill all the other entries such as Output File, Excel Sheet
Name and check UTF-8 Encoded (if required) and Click Next.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1096|

Now you will be prompted for mapping the fields to recognise the fields
by standard marc format.

Suppose for Field 0 that is first column I entered Map to: 022$a( Valid
ISSN for the continuing resource) and then click on Apply.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1097|

    **Note**

    You can customize Indicators and all other things, for more
    information on marc21 format visit the `official library of congress
    site <http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/>`__.

Similarly map all other fields and then Click on Finish.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1098|

And then a window will appear indicating that your Marc Text
File(\*.mrk) has been created.

Delimited Text Translator
|image1099|

Click Close and we have created a .mrk file from .xls file in this step.
You can view the file by double clicking on it.

`Convert .mrk file to .mrc <#convertmrk>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will convert .mrk file that we have created in the above step into
raw Marc format that can be directly imported into Koha.

For this again open MarcEdit and Select MARC Tools.

MARC Tools
|image1100|

Next Select MarcMaker to convert .mrk file into .mrc format.

MarcMaker
|image1101|

Locate your input file and name your output file. Then Click Execute.

MarcMaker
|image1102|

And it will show you the Result.

MarcMaker
|image1103|

Click Close and now we have raw Marc records with us (.mrc file).

`Import .mrc into Koha <#importmrc>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More information on importing records into Koha can be found in the
'`Stage MARC Records for Import <#stagemarc>`__' section of this manual.

Finally we will import above created .mrc file into Koha.

Click on Tools in your Koha staff client.

Koha Staff Client
|image1104|

Next Click on Stage MARC Records for Import.

Stage MARC Records for Import
|image1105|

After this, choose your previously created .mrc file and click on
Upload.

Stage File
|image1106|

You can also add comment about file and finally click on Stage For
Import.

Stage for Import
|image1107|

When the import is done, you will get a result something like this

Staged Records Summary
|image1108|

Next, click on Manage staged records.

Here you can even change matching rules.

Manage Staged Records
|image1109|

Click on Import this batch into catalog when you are done.

Thats it. After all the records get imported, check Status and it should
read "imported"

Finalize Import
|image1110|

You can even undo the Import operation.

And within few minutes, we have imported around 10,000 records in Koha

3. If you wish, archive the results file in another directory after
   processing

Run TalkingTech\_itiva\_inbound.pl --help for more information

OCLC Connexion Gateway
======================

Koha can be set to work with the OCLC Connextion Gateway. This allows
libraries to use OCLC Connexion as their cataloging tool and simply send
those records to Koha with a single click. The following instructions
will help you set up the OCLC Connexion Gateway, if you have a system
administrator you will want to consult with them on this process.

`Setting up OCLC service on Koha <#oclckohasetup>`__
----------------------------------------------------

First, you'll need to create a file somewhere on your system with
configuration information.  You could put this anywhere that is visible
to the account that will be running the service.

The file contains 11 lines. The first 6 will be about your Koha system:

::

    host: The IP address of your Koha server 
    port: The port you want to use for the Connexion service. This port must be different from your SIP port, or any other service 
    koha: The full URL of your staff client 
    log: The location (full file specification) of your log for the service 
    user: The default Koha username to use for importing 
    password: The password that goes with that username

The remaining lines describe how to do the staging:

::

    match: The name of the matching rule from your system to use 
    overlay_action: "replace", "create_new", or "ignore"-- what to do if there is a match 
    nomatch_action: "create_new" or "ignore"-- what to do if there is no match 
    item_action: "always_add","add_only_for_matches","add_only_for_new", or "ignore" -- what to do with embedded 952 item data 
    import_mode: "direct" or "stage"

A sample file would look like this:

::

    host: 1.2.3.4
    port: 8000
    log: /home/koha/koha-dev/var/log/connexion.log
    koha: http://kohastaff.myuniversity.edu
    user: koha_generic_staff
    password: password
    match: 001
    overlay_action: replace
    nomatch_action: create_new
    item_action: ignore
    import_mode: direct

When choosing an 'import\_mode' if you use "direct" then the staged
record will be immediately imported into Koha, and should be searchable
after your indexes catch up.  If you choose "stage", then the record
will be placed in a staged batch for you to later go the `Manage Staged
MARC Records <#managestaged>`__ tool to finish the import.

If you import multiple records, they'll be in the same batch, until that
batch is imported, then a new batch will be created.

In "direct" mode, each record will be in its' own batch.

To start the service, run the script:

::

    /location/of/connexion/import/daemon/connexion_import_daemon.pl -d -c /location/of/config/file.cnf

`Setting up your OCLC desktop client <#oclcdesktopsetup>`__
-----------------------------------------------------------

    **Note**

    Screenshots are OCLC Connexion Client v.2.50, Koha v.3.12

To set up the OCLC Connexion desktop client to connect to Koha, go to
Tools > Options, then choose the Export tab. Connexion Export Tab

-  Click the "Create..." button to set up a new destination, then choose
   "OCLC Gateway Export" and click OK.

   -  Enter the following information:

      -  "Host Name:" Your catalog’s appropriate IP address (from your
         `config file above <#oclckohasetup>`__)

      -  "Port:" Your catalog's appropriate port number (from your
         `config file above <#oclckohasetup>`__)

      -  "Login ID:" The cataloger's Koha login

      -  "Password:" The cataloger's Koha password

      -  "Notify Host Before Disconnect" = checked,

      -  "Timeout" = 100, "Retries" = 3, "Delay" = 0 (zero),

      -  "Send Local System Logon ID Password" = checked.

   OCLC Gateway Export Settings
   |image1111|

-  Select "OK" when finished, and you should see your new "Gateway
   Export" option listed (The catalog's IP address and port are blacked
   out in the following screenshot)

   Gateway Export Added

-  Click on "Record Characteristics" and make sure that the
   bibliographic records are using MARC21, UTF-8 Unicode, and click OK
   to save.

   Record Characteristics

You should be ready to go!  To export a record from OCLC Connexion
Client to Koha, just press F5 while the record is on-screen.  The export
dialog will pop up, and you'll see Connexion attempting to talk to Koha.
 You should get a message that the record was added or overlaid,
including its biblio number, and a URL that you can copy into your web
browser to jump straight to the record.

`Using the OCLC Connexion Gateway <#oclcgateway>`__
---------------------------------------------------

Records can be exported from Connexion either in a batch or one by one.

`Exporting records one by one <#oclconeexport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To export bibliographic records one by one, be sure your "Batch" options
are correct: from the "Tools" menu, select "Options", and select the
"Batch" tab. In the "Perform local actions in batch" area,
"Bibliographic Record Export" should be uncheckedConnexion batch options

When ready to export, from the "Action" menu, select "Export" or use the
F5 key. You will see a screen similar to the following if the import is
successful and if the record is new to the Catalog; you may copy & paste
the resulting URL into your Koha catalog to see the new record.Connexion
Export

If the record was overlaid, you will see a message to that effect in the
"OCLC Gateway Export Status" windowOverlay confirmation

`Exporting records in a batch <#oclcbatchexport>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To export bibliographic records in a batch, be sure your "Batch" options
are correct: from the "Tools" menu, select "Options", and select the
"Batch" tab. In the "Perform local actions in batch" area,
"Bibliographic Record Export" should be checkedOCLC Batch Export Options

When a record is ready to export, from the "Action" menu, select
"Export" or use the F5 key, and it’s export status will be "ready."

When ready to export the batch, from the "Batch" menu, select "Process
batch" and check the appropriate "Path" and "Export" boxesBatch import
process

The export will begin, and the bib records will be exported & imported
into Koha one by one; you will see "OCLC Gateway Export Status" windows,
as above, showing you the results of each export. That window will stay
there until you select "Close," and then the next record’s export/import
will begin. The process will continue until all records in the batch are
completed. Then you may or may not see the Connexion Client export
report (depending on your Client options for that).

`Items in OCLC <#oclcitems>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like to create your item records in OCLC you can do so by
addding a 952 for each item to the bib record you're cataloging. The
`Item/Holdings Cataloging Guide <#itemcatguide>`__ will break down what
subfields you can use in the 952, but at the minimum you want to have
subfield 2, a, b, and y on your items.

952
\\\\$2CLASSIFICATION$aHOMEBRANCHCODE$bHOLDINGBRANCHCODE$yITEMTYPECODE

-  The subfield 2 holds the classification code. This can be ddc for
   Dewey or lcc for Library of Congress or z for Custom. Other
   classification sources can be found in the `Classification
   Sources <#classificationsources>`__ area in administration

-  Subfield a is your home library and needs to be the code for your
   home library, not the library name. You can find these codes in the
   `Libraries & Groups <#libsgroups>`__ administration area.

-  Subfield b is your holding library and needs to be the code for your
   holding library, not the library name. You can find these codes in
   the `Libraries & Groups <#libsgroups>`__ administration area.

-  Subfield y is your item type code. It needs to be the code, not the
   item type name. You can find these codes in the `Item
   Types <#itemtypeadmin>`__ administration area.

952 \\\\$2ddc$aMAIN$bMAIN$yBOOK

In addition to these required fields you can enter any other subfield
you'd like. Most libraries will enter a call number in subfield o and a
barcode in subfield p as well. Review the `Item/Holdings Cataloging
Guide <#itemcatguide>`__ for a full list of subfields and values.

FAQs
====

`Display <#displayfaq>`__
-------------------------

`Custom Item Type/Authorized Value Icons <#customicons>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question:** Can I have my own set of item type images (or authorized
value icons)?

**Answer:**\ Absolutely. To add additional icons to your system you
simply add a new directory to
koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/img/itemtypeimg/ and to
koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/prog/itemtypeimg and put your icons in the new
directory. Your icons will show up in a new tab as soon as they are in
the folders.

-  **Note**

       Remember to put the icons in both places (on the OPAC and the
       intranet).

`Customizing Koha Images <#customkohaimages>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Can I customize the images in the OPAC?

**Answer**: Absolutely. Koha comes with a series of original images that
you can alter to meet your needs. The originals can be found in the
misc/interface\_customization/ directory.

`OPAC Display Fields <#opacdisplayfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What MARC fields print to the different OPAC screens in
Koha?

**Answer**: The XSLT preference must be set as follows for the following
fields to show

-  `OPACXSLTResultsDisplay <#OPACXSLTResultsDisplay>`__ = using XSLT
   stylesheets

-  `OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay <#OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay>`__ = using XSLT
   stylesheets

-  `DisplayOPACiconsXSLT <#DisplayOPACiconsXSLT>`__ = show

`Subtitle Display on Bib Records <#displaysubtitle>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: How do I get the subtitle to display on the detail pages
for my bib records?

**Answer**: Subtitle display now depends on there being a `keyword
mapping <#keywordmapping>`__ for the MARC field in question. Adding a
mapping for "subtitle" -> "245b" for an item's framework results in
display of the subtitle in OPAC and staff client search and detail pages
(although not in all instances where subtitles might be displayed, e.g.
the Cart).

`Show patrons the barcodes of items they have checked out <#opacbarcodesfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Can patrons see the barcodes for the items they have
checked out.

**Answer**: Not by default, but with a few edits to the patron record
you can make a barcode column appear on the patron's check out summary
in the OPAC. You can set up a `patron
attribute <#patronattributetypes>`__ with the value of SHOW\_BCODE and
`authorized value <#authorizedvalues>`__ of YES\_NO to make this happen.

Add SHOW\_BCODE patron attribute
|image1112|

Then on the `patron's record set the value <#editpatrons>`__ for
SHOW\_BCODE to yes.

Setting value for SHOW\_BCODE on patron record
|image1113|

This will add a column to the check out summary in the OPAC that shows
the patrons the barcodes of the items they have checked out.

Clicking on the 'Overdue' tab will show only the items that are overdue.

`Circulation/Notices <#circfaq>`__
----------------------------------

`Book drop Date <#dropboxfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: How is the book drop date is determined? Is it the last
open date for the checkout branch? Is it today's date minus one? Can the
book drop checkin date be set?

**Answer**: If the library is closed for four days for renovations, for
example, there would be more than one day needed for the book drop date.
You will only have one book drop date and that will be the last day that
the library open (determined by the holiday calendar) because there is
no real way to know what day the books were dropped into the box during
the 4 closed days. The only way to change the effective checkin date in
book drop mode is to modify the calendar.

`Holds to Pull and Holds Queue <#holdsreportsfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What is the difference between the `Holds
Queue <#holdsqueue>`__ and `Holds to Pull <#holdspull>`__?

**Answer**: The holds to pull report gives a simple list of what holds
need to be filled with available items. It should only be used in Koha
installations where there is only one library.

The holds queue tries to do the same thing, but in a 'smarter' way. This
allows it to split up the list by library, consult the `transport cost
matrix <#transportcostmatrix>`__ and refresh regularly to provide
different pull lists to each library.

`Duplicate Overdue Notices <#dupoverduefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Why are patrons getting two overdue notices?

**Answer**: This tool takes all branches in the overdue rules and sent
notifications to them. So, if you have a default rule & a branch rule,
the notification will be generated twice. A quick fix is to discard
"default rule" for instance.

`Printing Overdue Notices <#printoverduefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Can I print overdue notices for patrons without email
addresses on file?

**Answer**: Yes. The `overdue notice cron job <#overduenoticecron>`__
has a setting to generate the overdue notices as HTML for printing. An
example of this usage would be:

::

    overdue_notices.pl -t -html /tmp/noticedir -itemscontent issuedate,date_due,title,barcode,author 

In this example, we wanted to use only certain item fields in our
notices, so we specified itemscontent fields in the cron entry; that's
not a requirement for the feature.

The command line needs to specify a web-accessible directory where the
print notices will go -- they get a filename like
notices-2009-11-24.html (or holdnotices-2009-11-24.html). The overdue
notice itself can be formatted to fit a Z-mailer. Within the notice
file, the text is spaced down or over to where it will print properly on
the form. The script has code that wraps around the notice file to tell
the HTML to obey the formatting, and to do a page break between notices.
That's so that when staff print it out, they get one per page. We had to
add an extra syspref (`PrintNoticesMaxLines <#PrintNoticesMaxLines>`__)
to specify page length because our client allows a \_lot\_ of checkouts
which meant some notices were running onto multiple pages. That syspref
says to truncate the print notice at that page length and put in a
message about go check your OPAC account for the full list.

The print and email overdues use the same notice file. The print notices
for holds are different -- there's a separate HOLD\_PRINT notice file
and the system uses it if there's no email address. Then a nightly cron
job runs to gather those up from the message queue and put them in an
HTML file in the notice directory, as above.

The cron entry is gather\_print\_notices.pl /tmp/noticedir

`Unable to Renew Items <#renewfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: We're trying to renew some items for our patron. One of
the items is on hold and ineligible for renewal, but the other two items
refuse to renew even though they should be eligible. When I try to use
the override renewal limit, it just returns a little message that says
"renewal failed". Any idea what's going on here?

**Answer**: At the very least you will need to set an absolute `default
circulation rule <#circfinerules>`__. This rule should be set for the
default itemtype, default branchcode and default patron category. That
will catch anyone who doesn't match a specific rule. Patrons who do not
match a specific rule will get blocked from placing holds or renewing
items, since there was no baseline number of holds or renewals to
utilize.

`Unable to Place Holds <#holdsfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Why can't I place holds when I have all of the preferences
turned on.

**Answer**: You probably need to set a default circulation rule. At the
very least you will need to set an default circulation rule. This rule
should be set for all item types, all branches and all patron
categories. That will catch all instances that do not match a specific
rule. When checking out if you do not have a rule for the default
branch, default item and default patron category then you may see
patrons getting blocked from placing holds.

`Keyboard Shortcuts <#keyboardshort>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Do I have to use my mouse to access the checkout, checkin
and cataloging tabs at the top of the circulation pages?

**Answer**: You can jump between the tabs on the quick search box at the
top of the screen by using the following hot keys (if the tab is
available):

-  jump to the catalog search with Alt+Q

-  jump to the checkout with Alt+U

   -  this will not work for Mac user

-  jump to the checkin with Alt+R

    **Note**

    Mac users use the OPTION button in place of ALT

`SMS Notices/Messages <#smsnoticefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: I want Koha to send notices via SMS, what do I need to do?

**Answer**: First you need to choose a SMS service to use with Koha.
There is a list available here:
http://search.cpan.org/search?query=sms%3A%3Asend&mode=all Not all SMS
services available to libraries have Perl drivers, so be sure to check
this list to see if the provider you're considering is listed. If not
you want to ask your provider if they have a Perl module, if not you
should consider another service. Some common options in the US (that
have Perl drivers) are:

-  AQL (`www.aql.com <http://www.aql.com>`__)

-  Wadja (`wadja.com <http://wadja.com>`__)

-  Ipipi (`ipipi.com <http://ipipi.com>`__)

-  T-mobile

-  SMSDiscount (`smsdiscount.com <http://smsdiscount.com>`__)

-  Clickatell

**Question**: What about in India?

**Answer**: India does not yet have too many options here. This is
partly due to the Telecom regulatory authority's (TRAI) stipulations
about transactional SMSes and limits on the number of SMSes that may be
sent / received per users per day. India specific drivers include:

-  Unicel Technologies Pvt Ltd (`unicel.in <http://unicel.in>`__)

`Cataloging <#catfaq>`__
------------------------

`Authority Fields <#authorityfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question:**\ Why can't I edit 1xx, 6xx, or 7xx fields in my catalog
record?

**Answer:** These fields are authority controlled and you probably have
the `BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__ set to "Don't
allow". When it is set to "Don't allow" these fields will be locked and
require you to search for an existing authority record to populate the
field with. To allow typing in these authority fields set
`BiblioAddsAuthorities <#BiblioAddsAuthorities>`__ to 'Allow'.

    **Note**

    Fields affected by this preference will show a lock symbol in them

Fields affected by this preference show a lock in the field
|image1115|

`Koha to MARC Mapping <#kohamarcfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What's the relationship between 'Koha to MARC Mapping' and
'MARC Bibliographic Frameworks'?

**Answer**: Mapping can be defined through 'MARC Bibliographic
Frameworks' OR 'Koha to MARC Mapping'. 'Koha to MARC Mapping' is just a
shortcut to speed up linkage. If you change a mapping in one of these
modules, the mapping will change in the other as well. (In other words,
the two modules 'overwrite' each other in order to prevent conflicts
from existing in Koha).

`Number of Items Per Bib Record <#itemsperbibfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Is there a limit on the number of items I can attach to a
bib record?

**Answer**: There is no explicit limit to the number of items you can
attach to a bibliographic record, but if you attach enough of them, your
MARC record will exceed the maximum file size limit for the ISO 2709
standard, which breaks indexing for that record. I've found this occurs
somewhere between 600 and 1000 items on a 'normal' bibliographic record.

`Analytics <#analyticsfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: I am using the
`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ feature, but my links
in the OPAC and Staff Client to 'Show Analytics' are not working.

**Answer**: If you plan on using
`EasyAnalyticalRecords <#EasyAnalyticalRecords>`__ you will want to make
sure to set your `UseControlNumber <#UseControlNumber>`__ preference to
"Don't use," this will prevent broken links.

`Acquisitions <#acqfaq>`__
--------------------------

`Planning Categories <#planningcatfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What is a planning category?

**Answer**: When you plan in advance for the way your budget is going to
be spent, you initially plan for how it's going to be spent over time,
that's the most natural thing to do.

So you plan for $1000 in Jan. $1000 in Feb., $3000 in March, etc. You
can basically do the same thing with a list of values in lieu of the
months.

Say you have a list like this one:

-  < 1 month

-  < 6 months

-  < 1 year

-  < 3 years

-  < 10 years

-  > 10 years

The list is meant to represent when the books acquired where published.
Then you plan for it, saying: we went to spend at list 40% of our
budgets on books published less than a year ago, 10% on books more than
10 years old, etc.

Upon acquiring new material, you'll be able to select, for a given item,
a value from this list in a drop down. Then, after the material has been
acquired, at the end of the year, you'll be able to compare the goals
set, with what's been achieved.

`Serials <#serialsfaq>`__
-------------------------

`Advanced Patterns <#advancedpatternfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What is the 'inner counter' on the advanced serials
pattern interface?

**Answer**: I think it is better to give an example to understand this :

Example for a monthly subscription :

-  First issue publication date : April 2010

-  Numbering : No {X}, year {Y}

-  First issue : No 4, year 2010

For the year Y : you will want the year change on January 2011

So, the advanced pattern for Y will be :

-  Add : 1

-  once every : 12

-  When more than 9999999

-  inner counter : 3

-  Set back to 0

-  Begins with 2010

Year is going to change after 12 received issues from April 2010, that
is in April 2011 if you don't set inner counter. Set inner counter to 3
will say to Koha : change year after 12-3 = 9 received issues.

Inner counter says to Koha to take into account the first issues of the
year, even if they are not received with Koha. If you begin with first
issue of the year write nothing or 0.

`Reports <#reportsfaq>`__
-------------------------

`Define Codes Stored in DB <#accounttypefaq>`__

`Fines Table <#finescodefaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question:** What do the codes in the accounttype field in the
accountlines table stand for?

**Answer:**

-  A = Account management fee

-  C = Credit

-  F = Overdue fine

-  FOR = Forgiven

-  FU = Overdue, still acccruing

-  L = Lost item

-  LR = Lost item returned/refunded

-  M = Sundry

-  N = New card

-  PAY = Payment

-  W = Writeoff

`Statistics Table <#statscodefaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question:**\ What are the possible codes for the type field in the
statistics table?

      patron (category type = 'X') is returned

-  issue

-  return

-  renew

-  writeoff

-  CreditXXX

   -  The XXX stores different types of fee credits, so a query to catch
      them all would include a clause like "type LIKE 'Credit%'"

`Reserves Table <#rescodefaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: What are the possible codes for the found field in the
reserves and old\_reserves tables?

**Answer**:

   chosen the item

-  T = Transit: the reserve is linked to an item but is in transit to
   the pickup branch

-  W = Waiting: the reserve is linked to an item, is at the pickup
   branch, and is waiting on the hold shelf

-  F = Finished: the reserve has been completed, and is done

**Question**: What are the possible codes in the message\_attribute\_id
field in the borrower\_message\_preferences table?

**Answer**:

-  2 = advanced notice

-  6 = item checkout

-  4 = hold filled

-  1 = item due

-  5 = item check in

`Runtime Parameters <#runtimefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Is there a way to filter my custom SQL reports before they
run?

**Answer**: If you feel that your report might be too resource intensive
you might want to consider using runtime parameters to your query.
Runtime parameters basically make a filter appear before the report is
run to save your system resources.

There is a specific syntax that Koha will understand as 'ask for values
when running the report'. The syntax is <<Question to
ask\|authorized\_value>>.

-  The << and >> are just delimiters. You must put << at the beginning
   and >> at the end of your parameter

-  The 'Question to ask' will be displayed on the left of the string to
   enter.

-  The authorized\_value can be omitted if not applicable. If it
   contains an authorized value category, or branches or itemtype or
   categorycode or biblio\_framework, a list with the Koha authorized
   values will be displayed instead of a free field Note that you can
   have more than one parameter in a given SQL Note that entering
   nothing at run time won't probably work as you expect. It will be
   considered as "value empty" not as "ignore this parameter". For
   example entering nothing for : "title=<<Enter title>>" will display
   results with title='' (no title). If you want to have to have
   something not mandatory, use "title like <<Enter title>>" and enter a
   % at run time instead of nothing

Examples:

-  SELECT surname,firstname FROM borrowers WHERE branchcode=<<Enter
   patrons library\|branches>> AND surname like <<Enter filter for
   patron surname (% if none)>>

-  SELECT \* FROM items WHERE homebranch = <<Pick your
   branch\|branches>> and barcode like <<Partial barcode value here>>

-  SELECT title , author FROM biblio WHERE frameworkcode=<<Enter the
   frameworkcode\|biblio\_framework>>

    **Note**

    To generate a date picker calendar to the right of the field when
    running a report you can use the 'date' keyword like this: <<Enter
    Date\|date>>

    Date Picker
    |image1116|

    **Note**

    You have to put "%" in a text box to 'leave it blank'. Otherwise, it
    literally looks for "" (empty string) as the value for the field.

    **Important**

    In addition to using any authorized value code to generate a
    dropdown, you can use the following values as well: Framework codes
    (biblio\_framework), Branches (branches), Item Types (itemtypes) and
    Patron Categories (categorycode). For example a branch pull down
    would be generated like this <<Branch\|branches>>

    Branch pull down
    |image1117|

`Results Limited <#reportlimitfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: When I download my report it's limited to 10,000 results,
how do I get all of the results to download?

**Answer**: There is a limit of 10,000 records put on SQL statements
entered in Koha. To get around this you want to add 'LIMIT 100000' to
the end of your SQL statement (or any other number above 10,000.

`Searching <#searchfaq>`__
--------------------------

`Advanced Search <#advancedsearchfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Scan Indexes <#scanindexfaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: What does 'scan indexes' on the advanced search page mean?

**Answer**: When you choose an index, enter a term, click 'scan indexes'
and do the search, Koha displays the searched term and the following
terms found in this index with the number of corresponding records That
is search is not made directly in the catalog, but first in the indexes
It works only for one index at once, and only with no limit in Location
(All libraries needed)

`Searching for Terms that Start With a Character <#searchstartswith>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: How do I search for all titles that start with the letter
'C'?

**Answer**: You can choose to search for things that start with a
character or series of characters by using the CCL 'first-in-subfield'

-  example: ti,first-in-subfield=C

`Wildcard Searching <#wildcardsearchfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**:What is the difference between a keyword search using the
'\*' (asterisk) versus a keyword search using the '%' (percent)? Both
work in the catalog, but return different sets. Why?

**Answer**: A wildcard is a character (\*,?,%,.) that can be used to
represent one or more characters in a word. Two of the wildcard
characters that can be used in Koha searches are the asterisk ('\*') and
the percent sign ('%'). However, these two characters act differently
when used in searching.

The '\*' is going to force a more exact search of the first few
characters you enter prior to the '\*'. The asterisk will allow for an
infinite number of characters in the search as long as the first few
characters designated by your search remain the same. For example,
searching for authors using the term, Smi\*, will return a list that may
include Smith, Smithers, Smithfield, Smiley, etc depending on the
authors in your database.

The '%' will treat the words you enter in the terms of "is like". So a
search of Smi% will search for words like Smi. This results in a much
more varied results list. For example, a search on Smi% will return a
list containing Smothers, Smith, Smelley, Smithfield and many others
depending on what is your database.

The bottom line in searching with wildcards: '\*' is more exact while
'%' searches for like terms.

`Title Searching <#titlesearchingfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Why does my Zebra title search for 'Help' not turn up 'The
help' in the first pages of results?

**Answer**: When doing a title search, you actually want to search for
the title (i.e., 'the help' rather than just 'help'), and it will bubble
right up to the top. If you're just searching for 'help' then the
relevance ranking is going to affect the results you see.

When it comes to relevance in Zebra, here's what's happening. First, the
search is done. If you search for the title "help", then any title that
has "help" in it comes back. Then from those records, separately, it
does relevance on the \*whole\* record. The more your word appears, the
more relevant, and some MARC tags are worth more points than others. So
a self-help book with 505 notes where "help" appears a \*lot\* will be
at the top, regardless of keyword or title.

But when you add a \*second word\*, that helps it figure things out, as
it's weighing the relevance of both words and the phrase. Because of the
way relevance works, if you search "the help", then "the help" or "the
help I need" are more relevant than "the way to help", because they
appear together in order. Likewise, "help the girl" would be lower
relevance, because it's out of order, and "help for the homeless" would
be lower still, as they're out of order, and apart.

The moral of the story is that single word searches, particularly on
common words, will always struggle a bit; it can't evaluate relevance
well, because you've not given it enough input.

`Enhanced Content <#enhancedcontentfaq>`__
------------------------------------------

`FRBRizing Content <#frbrfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question:**\ At our public library we are running a Koha installation
and we've tried to turn on all the nice functionalities in Koha such as
the frbrising tool, but do not get the same result as Nelsonville public
library.

**Answer:**\ In fact, this feature is quite tricky to make that right.
First it looks at XISBN service. And then search in your database for
that ISBN. So both XISBN and your internal ISBN (in biblio table) have
to be normalized. You could therefore use the script
misc/batchupdateISBNs.pl (it removes all the - in your local ISBNs)

`Amazon <#amzfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`All Amazon Content <#amazonfaq>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Question**: I have all of the Amazon preferences turned on and have
entered both of my keys, but none of the content appears in my system,
why is that?

**Answer**: Amazon's API checks your server time on all requests and if
your server time is not set properly requests will be denied. To resolve
this issue be sure to set your system time appropriately. Once that
change in made Amazon content should appear immediately.

On Debian the the command is *date -s "2010-06-30 17:21"* (with the
proper date and time for your timezone).

`System Administration <#systemfaq>`__
--------------------------------------

`Errors in Zebra Cron <#zebracronfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: I am noticing some errors in the
koha-zebradaemon-output.log file. When new records are added it takes a
bit longer to index than we think they should. Running rebuild zebra is
often faster. Zebra ends up indexing and search works, but I am
concerned about the errors. Any ideas?

**Answer**: Rebuild\_zebra.pl -r deletes all of the files in the Zebra
db directories (such as reci-0.mf) and then recreates them. Thus,
permissions will be lost, and the files will be owned by the user who
ran rebuild\_zebra.pl. If one rebuilds the zebra indexes as root, the
daemons, which typically run under the user Koha, will not be able to
update the indexes. Thus, it's important then that the zebra rebuilds
are put in the cronjob file of the user Koha, and not root. Also
important is that other users, such as root, don't manually execute
rebuilds.

If one desires that another user be able to execute rebuild\_zebra.pl,
he should be given the permission to execute 'sudo -u Koha
.../rebuild\_zebra.pl,' (if you want to do this, you also have to edit
the sudoers file to pass the PERL5LIB variable with the env\_keep option
as by default sudo strips away almost all environment variables). Or, as
root user, one can use a simple 'su koha' and then the rebuild\_zebra.pl
command.

I've also tried to set the sticky bit on rebuild\_zebra.pl, but for
whatever reason it didn't seem to work due to some problem with the
PERL5LIB variable that I wasn't able to figure. That seems to me the
easiest thing to do, if anybody has any idea how to make it work. If it
worked and were the default, I think it would help folks to avoid a
great deal of the problems that come up with zebra.

`Making Z39.50 Target Public <#publicztarget>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Could someone tell me the exact steps I need to take to
configure Zebra to expose my Koha 3 db as a public Z39.50 service?

**Answer**: Edit the KOHA\_CONF file that your Koha is using. Uncomment
the publicserver line like:

<!-- <listen id="publicserver" >tcp:@:9999</listen> -->

to be:

<listen id="publicserver" >tcp:@:9999</listen>

Then restart zebasrv and connect on the port specified (9999).

`Shelving Location Authorized Values <#authvalfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: When editing an item, the new shelving location I created
is not showing up by default in the items where I assigned it to.

**Answer**: This is because you created the new shelving location with a
code value of 0 (zero) Just FYI the system interprets authorized values
of 0 as equaling a null so when you edit a record in cataloging where
the authorized value in a field was assigned where the code was 0, the
value displays as null in the item editor (or MARC editor) instead of
the value the library meant it to be.

`Why do I need Authorized Values? <#whyauthvals>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Why would I want to define authorized values for MARC
tags?

**Answer**: Authorized Values create a 'controlled vocabulary' for your
staff. As an example, let us assume that your Koha installation is used
by several libraries, and you use MARC 21. You might want to restrict
the 850a MARC subfield to the institution codes for just those
libraries. In that case, you could define an authorized values category
(perhaps called "INST") and enter the institution codes as the
authorized values for that category.

    **Note**

    Koha automatically sets up authorized value categories for your item
    types and branch codes, and you can link these authorized values to
    MARC subfields when you set up your MARC tag structure.

`How do I clean up the sessions table? <#sessionstblfaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: Is there a periodic job that can be run to cull old
sessions from the table? We don't want to backup all the useless session
data every night.

**Answer**: You can run `cleanup database cron job <#cleandbcron>`__.

Or just before doing a backup command (mysqldump), you can truncate
session table:  

::

    mysql -u<kohauser -p<password <koha-db-name -e 'TRUNCATE TABLE sessions'

`Hardware <#hardwarefaq>`__
---------------------------

`Barcode Scanners <#barcodefaq>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Question**: What barcode scanners have been known to work with Koha?

**Answer**: The simple rule of thumb is, does it act like a keyboard
device?, if so, it will work. (i.e. can you take the scanner, scan a
barcode and have it show up in a text editor, if so, it will work.)

The main points to check are that it connects to your PC conveniently
(can be USB or "keyboard wedge" which means it connects in line with the
keyboard, which is useful with older computers), and that it scans the
barcode type that you are using.

It is a good idea to test some 'used' barcodes if you have any, to see
whether the scanner can read scuffed or slightly wrinkled ones
successfully. Most scanners are capable of reading several barcode types
- there are many, and the specification should list the ones it can
read. You may need to adjust settings slightly, such as prefix and
suffix characters, or whether you want to send an 'enter' character or
not.

One more tip - some can be set 'always on' and may come with a stand,
some have triggers under the handle, some have buttons on top, some are
held like a pen. Think about the staff working with the hardware before
choosing, as a button in the wrong place can be very awkward to use.

`Printers used by Koha libraries <#kohaprinters>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  POS-X receipt printer

-  Star Micronics printer (exact model unknown) with a generic/plain
   text driver.

-  Star SP2000 (Nelsonville)

-  Star TSP-100 futurePRINT (Geauga)

   -  "I know there have been a lot of questions on receipt printers so
      I thought I'd pass on my findings. We have been testing the Star
      TSP-100 futurePRINT. I found this print to be VERY easy to
      configure for Koha. I was even able to customize the print job by
      adding our system logo (a .gif) to the top of every receipt. Also
      with a bitmap created in Paint was able to add a message at the
      bottom of each receipt with the contact information, hours and
      website for the library that the materials were checked out at."

Extending Koha
==============

`Amazon lookup script for Koha libraries <#amzlookup>`__
--------------------------------------------------------

We order most of our materials from Amazon, so I've been looking for a
convenient way to tell if a book under consideration is in our catalog
already.

Greasemonkey & a custom user script fit the bill nicely:

-  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748

-  http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/56847

A few caveats:

-  Like most scripts, this one was designed to work with Firefox; I
   haven't explored getting it to work with other browsers.

-  I'm not a JavaScript programmer -- this was adapted from others'
   work. Just a few lines would have to be changed to get the script to
   work with your catalog.

-  It depends on the existence of ISBN for the item in question, so
   movies, older books, etc. would not work.

Others have added all sorts of bells & whistles: XISBN lookups to search
for related titles, custom messages based on the status of items (on
order, on hold, etc.), ... just search the UserScripts site for Amazon +
library. For a later date!

`Keyword Clouds <#extendkeywordclouds>`__
-----------------------------------------

In addition to the traditional tag cloud available in Koha, there is a
way to generate clouds for popular subjects within Koha.

The `Author/Subject Cloud cron job <#keywordclouds>`__ is used to help
with this process. This cron job sends its output to files.

-  /home/koha/mylibrary/koharoot/koha-tmpl/cloud-author.html

-  /home/koha/yourlibrary/koharoot/koha-tmpl/cloud-subject.html

This means that you can produce clouds for authors, collective author,
all kind of subjects, classifications, etc. And since it works on zebra
indexes, it is quick, even on large DBs. Tags clouds are sent to files.
It's up to library webmaster to deal with those files in order to
include them in `OPACMainUserBlock <#OpacMainUserBlock>`__, or include
them into their library CMS.

Some libraries even send the file into a Samba shared folder where
webmaster take them, eventually clean them a little bit before
integrating them into navigation widgets or pages.

`Newest Titles Pulldown <#newtitlesoption>`__
---------------------------------------------

Often we want to add a way for our patrons to do searches for the newest
items. In this example I'll show you how to create a pull down menu of
the newest items by item type. These tips will work (with a couple
changes) for collection codes or shelving locations as well.

First, it's important to note that every link in Koha is a permanent
link. This means if I do a search for everything of a specific item type
sorted by the acquisitions date and bookmark that URL, whenever I click
it I'll see the newest items of that type on the first few pages of the
results.

I took this knowledge and wrote a form takes this functionality in to
consideration. It basically just does a search of your Koha catalog for
a specific item type and sorts the results by acquisitions date.

The first thing I did was write a MySQL statement to generate a list of
item types for me - why copy and paste when you can use the power of
MySQL?

::

    select concat('<option value=\"mc-itype:', itemtype, '\">',description,'</option>') from itemtypes

The above looks at the itemtypes table and slaps the necessary HTML
around each item type for me. I then exported that to CSV and opened it
in my text editor and added the other parts of the form.

::

    <p><strong>New Items</strong></p>
    <p><form name="searchform" method="get" action="/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl">
    <input name="idx" value="kw" type="hidden">
    <input name="sort_by" value="acqdate_dsc" type="hidden">
    <input name="do" value="OK" type="hidden">
    <select name="limit" onchange="this.form.submit()">
    <option>-- Please choose --</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:BOOK">Book</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:BOOKCD">Book on CD</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:DVD">DVD</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:LRG_PRINT">Large print book</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:MAGAZINE">Magazine</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:NEWSPAPER">Newspaper</option>
    <option value="mc-itype:VIDEO">Videocassette</option>
    </select>
    </form>
    </p>

Now, what does all of that mean? The important bits are these:

First the starting of the form.

::

    <p><form name="searchform" method="get" action="/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl">

This tells the browser to take any value selected and put it at the end
of this http://YOURSITE/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl. If you want to
embed this form on your library website (and not on your OPAC) you can
put the full OPAC URL in there.

Next, there is a hidden value that is telling the search to sort by
acquisitions date descending (newest items at the top):

::

    <input name="sort_by" value="acqdate_dsc" type="hidden">

And finally you have an option for each item type you want people to
search.

::

    <option value="mc-itype:BOOK">Book</option>

These options each include the string "mc-itype:" which tells Koha to do
an item type search.

Once you have all of that in place you can copy and paste the form to
somewhere on your OPAC. The `Farmington Public Libraries
OPAC <http://catalog.farmingtonlibraries.org>`__ has a few examples of
this on the left.

`Cataloging and Searching by Color <#colorsearch>`__
----------------------------------------------------

One of the icon sets installed in Koha includes a series of colors. This
set can be used to catalog and search by color if you'd like. This guide
will walk you use changing collection code to color in Koha so that you
can do this.

The following SQL could be used to add these colors to the CCODE
authorized value category in a batch. If you wanted to use these colors
for another authorized value you'd have to edit this to use that
category:

::

        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','000000','Black','','colors/000000.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','66cc66','Bright Green','','colors/66cc66.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','99cc33','Olive','','colors/99cc33.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','3333cc','Dark Blue','','colors/3333cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','006600' ,'Dark Green','','colors/006600.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','6600cc','Plum','','colors/6600cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','6666cc','Purple','','colors/6666cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','9999cc','Light Purple','','colors/9999cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','660000' ,'Burgundy','','colors/660000.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','663333' ,'Brown','','colors/663333.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','990000' ,'Red','','colors/990000.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','996633' ,'Tan','','colors/996633.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','999999' ,'Gray','','colors/999999.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc66cc','Pink','','colors/cc66cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc99cc','Bubble Gum','','colors/cc99cc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc3333' ,'Orange','','colors/cc3333.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc6666' ,'Peach','','colors/cc6666.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cc9999' ,'Rose','','colors/cc9999.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','cccc00' ,'Gold','','colors/cccc00.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','ffff33' ,'Yellow','','colors/ffff33.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','ffffcc','Cream','','colors/ffffcc.png');
        insert into authorised_values (category, authorised_value, lib,
         lib_opac, imageurl) values ('CCODE','ffffff','White','','colors/ffffff.png');

If you would like to choose the colors manually you can do that via the
`Authorized Values <#authorizedvalues>`__ administration area.

Colors for CCODE
|image1118|

Next you'll want to `update the frameworks <#marcbibframeworks>`__ so
that the 952$8 (if you're using collection code) label to says Color.

Once you have that in place you can start to catalog items by color.

Finally you'll want to add the following JQuery to your preferences so
that it will relabel 'Collection' to 'Color'

`IntranetUserJS <#intranetuserjs>`__

::

    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#advsearch-tab-ccode a:contains('Collection')").text("Color");
        $("#holdings th:contains('Collection')").text("Color");
        });

`OPACUserJS <#opacuserjs>`__

::

    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#advsearch-tab-ccode a:contains('Collection')").text("Color");
        $('#item_ccode').text("Color");
        });

Koha and Your Website
=====================

This appendix will include tips for integrating Koha in to your library
website.

`Koha search on your site <#embedsearch>`__
-------------------------------------------

Often you'll want to add a Koha search box to your library website. To
do so, just copy and paste the following code in to your library website
and update the YOURCATALOG bit with your catalog's URL and you're set to
go.

::

    <form name="searchform" method="get" action="http://YOURCATLOG/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl" id="searchform">
    <input id="transl1" name="q" type="text"><p>

GNU General Public License version 3
====================================

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

**Preamble**

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

**0. Definitions.**

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
item in the list meets this criterion.

**1. Source Code.**

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major
Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work,
or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
those activities. However, it does not include the work's System
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes
interface definition files associated with source files for the work,
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms
and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

**2. Basic Permissions.**

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
it unnecessary.

**3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.**

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

**4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.**

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

**5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.**

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
   and giving a relevant date.

b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
   under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
   requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
   notices".

c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
   anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
   therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
   terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how
   they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the
   work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if
   you have separately received it.

d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
   Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
   interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
   need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond
what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
aggregate.

**6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.**

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
   used for software interchange.

b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
   offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
   offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
   anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
   Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
   covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
   used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
   reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or
   (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
   no charge.

c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
   is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
   received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
   subsection 6b.

d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
   (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
   further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
   Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy
   the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
   on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that
   supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
   directions next to the object code saying where to find the
   Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
   Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
   available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
   inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
   the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
   subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used"
refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless
of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the
particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses,
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the
product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been
installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code
form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking,
reading or copying.

**7. Additional Terms.**

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
   of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
   author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
   Notices displayed by works containing it; or

c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
   requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
   reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
   authors of the material; or

e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
   names, trademarks, or service marks; or

f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
   by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
   contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
   liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
   licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not
survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
requirements apply either way.

**8. Termination.**

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

**9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.**

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

**10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.**

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale,
or importing the Program or any portion of it.

**11. Patents.**

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work
and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
available to you under applicable patent law.

**12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.**

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
Program.

**13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work,
and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination
as such.

**14. Revised Versions of this License.**

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

**15. Disclaimer of Warranty.**

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**16. Limitation of Liability.**

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.**

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.

**END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

**How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs**

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

::

    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
    Copyright (C) year name of author

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
      

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

::

    program Copyright (C) year name of author
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
      

The hypothetical commands \`\ ``show w``' and \`\ ``show c``' should
show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course,
your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you
would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the
GNU GPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first,
please read http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.
