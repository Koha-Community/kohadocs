"the Z39.50 bib-1 attribute list, plus the Koha local use attributes for "
"Biblio Indexes, Items Index, and Fixed Fields and other special indexes. "
"The Z39.50 Bib-1 profile is made up of several different types of "
"attributes: Use, Relation, Position, Structure, Truncation, and "
"Completeness. The bib-1 'Use' attribute is represented on the chart; the "
"other attributes are used primarily when doing searches. While there are "
"over 150+ use attributes that could be used to define your indexing set, "
"it's unlikely that you will choose to use them all. The attributes you "
"elect to use are those that become the indexing rules for your database. "
"The other five attribute sets define the various ways that a search can "
"be further defined, and will not specifically be addressed in this "
"document. For a complete list of the standard Bib-1 attributes, go to "
"http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html."

"The second file is "

"etc/zebradb/marc\\_defs/[marc21\\|unimarc]/biblios/biblio-koha-"
"indexdefs.xml if you use dom indexing [the default from 3.18]. Either "
"files contains the abstract syntax which maps the MARC21 tags to the set "
"of Use Attributes you choose to use. To be more precise the xml file to "
"be activate needs to be transform into biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl, read "
