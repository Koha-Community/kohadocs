"Harvesting (OAI-PMH) there are two groups of 'participants': Data "
"Providers and Service Providers. Data Providers (open archives, "
"repositories) provide free access to metadata, and may, but do not "
"necessarily, offer free access to full texts or other resources. OAI-PMH "
"provides an easy to implement, low barrier solution for Data Providers. "
"Service Providers use the OAI interfaces of the Data Providers to harvest"
" and store metadata. Note that this means that there are no live search "
"requests to the Data Providers; rather, services are based on the "
"harvested data via OAI-PMH. Koha at present can only act as a Data "
"Provider. It can not harvest from other repositories. The biggest "
"stumbling block to having Koha harvest from other repositories is that "
"MARC is the only metadata format that Koha indexes natively. Visit "
"http://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/english/page3.htm for diagrams of how "
"OAI-PMH works."
