"For the Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-"
"PMH) there are two groups of 'participants': Data Providers and Service "
"Providers. Data Providers (open archives, repositories) provide free "
"access to metadata, and may, but do not necessarily, offer free access to"
" full texts or other resources. OAI-PMH provides an easy to implement, "
"low barrier solution for Data Providers. Service Providers use the OAI "
"interfaces of the Data Providers to harvest and store metadata. Note that"
" this means that there are no live search requests to the Data Providers;"
" rather, services are based on the harvested data via OAI-PMH."

"Koha at present can only act as a Data Provider. It can not harvest from "
"other repositories. The biggest stumbling block to having Koha harvest "
"from other repositories is that MARC is the only metadata format that "
"Koha indexes natively. Visit "

"OAI-PMH works."

"Often times libraries will want to add a flowing widget with new "
"materials at the library to their main public catalog page. To do this "
"you can use a widget from any number of services (usually for a cost) or "
"you can `enable plugins <#pluginsystem>`__ in Koha and use the `Cover "
"Flow plugin <http://git.bywatersolutions.com/koha-"
"plugins.git/shortlog/refs/heads/cover_flow>`__ which is based on the "
"`Flipster <https://github.com/drien/jquery-flipster>`__, a responsive "
"jQuery coverflow plugin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the plugin is installed, the steps to get your coverflow to show up "
"are as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:351
msgid ""
"First, you need to create one or more public reports for your coverflow "
"widget or widgets to be based on. This is how the plugin knows what the "
"content of your widget should contain. Each report needs only three "
"columns; title, biblionumber, and isbn. It is important that you have a "
"good and valid isbn, as that is the datum used to actually fetch the "
"cover. In the iteration of the plugin, we are using Amazon cover images, "
"but I believe in the end I will make the cover image fetcher configurable"
" so we can use any data source for cover image fetching."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:360
msgid ""
"Second, we need to configure the plugin. The plugin configuration is a "
"single text area that uses YAML ( actually, it’s JSON, whcih is a subset "
"of YAML ) to store the configuration options. In this example it looks "
"like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:372
msgid ""
"In this example, we are telling the plugin to use the report with id 42, "
"and use it to create a coverflow widget to replace the HTML element with "
"the id “coverflow”. The options list is passed directly to Flipster, so "
"any options supported by Flipster can be set from the plugin "
"configuration! In fact, in addition to the traditional coverflow, "
"Flipster has a “carousel” mode which is a much more compact version of "
"the coverflow. You can also configure which cover the widget will start "
"on, among other options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:381
msgid ""
"At the time the plugins options are saved or updated, the plugin will "
"then generate some minified JavaScript code that is automatically stored "
"in the Koha system preference OPACUserJS. Here is an example of the "
"output:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:393
msgid ""
"Why do this? For speed! Rather than regenerating this code each and every"
" time the page loads, we can generate it once, and use it over and over "
"again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:397
msgid ""
"If you inspect the code closely, you’ll notice it references a script "
"“coverflow.pl”. This is a script that is included with the coverflow "
"plugin. Since we need to access this from the OPAC ( and we don’t want to"
" set off any XSS attack alarms ), we need to modify the web server "
"configuration for the public catalog and add the followup to it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:407
msgid ""
"This line gives us access to the coverflow.pl script from the OPAC. This "
"script retrieves the report data and passes it back to the public catalog"
" for creating the coverflow widget. Koha::Cache is supported in order to "
"make the widget load as quickly as possible!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:412
msgid ""
"The final step is to put your selector element somewhere in your public "
"catalog. In this example, I put the following in the system preference "
"OpacMainUserBlock:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/17_miscellaneous.rst:420
msgid ""
"Once that is in place, you need only refresh your OPAC page, and there "
"you have it, your very own catalog coverflow widget! Not only do these "
"coverflows look great on a computer screen, but they look great on mobile"
" platforms as well, and are even touch responsive!"
